            "description": "The OXO Good Grips Box Grater does the work of a slicer and three Graters in one compact tool that fits conveniently in any drawer. Wide stainless steel coarse and medium grating surfaces are ideal for cheese, vegetables, chocolate and more. A slimmer fine grating surface is just right for nutmeg and ginger, and the slicing surface yields perfect slices of cucumber, zucchini, cheese and more. The soft, comfortable, non-slip handle ensures a secure grip and cushions hands during repetitive grating motions. A non-slip base keeps the Box Grater steady on a plate or cutting board. A convenient storage container with non-slip base, measurement markings and a lid attaches to the bottom of the Grater for catching and storing freshly grated ingredients. The container stores conveniently inside the Grater when not in use.",
