This Bladed Meat Tenderizer helps poultry self-baste, allows meat to retain its natural juices and promotes uniform cooking. The contoured shape with non-slip grip is comfortable to hold while stamping, and the clear base makes it easy to see the indent left in the meat for easy, even tenderization.
