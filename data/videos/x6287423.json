Eat eat I met Rick when I was working at Kraft and I'd always remember him coming down he had one of them is here she is and if ever she's been instrumental in not only providing grow vegetables for the past nine years he's been responsible for teaching and educating us. How much was it wrong and not just for vegetables in the big leagues and just about everything trying to sort of teach us the cycle in which food is grown and that it just doesn't come in a plastic bag. The relationship between farmers and move through is important because we're trying to promote small business and sell the best products possible and the concept of selling local sort of ridiculous because that's what you're supposed to do anyway and they're our neighbors and we've got to support them.",
