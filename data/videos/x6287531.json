    "transcripts": "The Haze duvet cover and bedding collection by Kenneth Cole reaction home was designed exclusively for Bed Bath and Beyond. The first layer that begins with the snow white sateen sheet set featuring an embroidered Baroda stitched in cool tones at the hem of the sheet and the pillow sham, adding a subtle dressmakers detail. The euro shams add an ideal backdrop to the bed. They are 100 percent cotton velvet in a rich inc blue. The haze comforter and pillow shams are 100 percent cotton brushed sateen with a multi-color gradient pattern transitioning from inc blue to amethyst. The coordinating pillow shams are finished with the same pattern as the comforter. The resulting bed is cool and relaxing. The decorative pillows accenting the spread suite are an emerald tipped faux pillow, an accordion pleated pillow in inc blue beads and a shimmering pillow with iridescent beads in snow. The pillows add the key fashion elements to complete this bed look. The Haze duvet cover and bedding is part of the Kenneth Cole reaction home collection. It is available exclusively online and at select Bed Bath and Beyond stores.",
