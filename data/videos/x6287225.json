First make sure your dirty water tank is empty if it's full it will stop picking up and you'll hear a change in pitch like this. You can empty it by removing the tank like so and dumping it out in the sink. Next remove the lid and rinse it along with the filter. Then place the lid back on. Make sure the spores spout cap is placed back in. Next remove your nozzle by lifting up this release latch and pulling it up rinse it under warm water in the sink. Now replace it then place your recovery tank back in make sure it's locked into the base. Lastly check the tool door here and make sure that it's closed. If it's open air will escape and there won't be any suction. Once everything is back together you should notice a significant change in pick up performance. Let us know if you need any more help by a Facebook, Twitter or give us a call at 809 four four nine two zero zero.",
