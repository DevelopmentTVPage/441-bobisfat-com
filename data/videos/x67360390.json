We want to keep it stable because it gets all roly poly on us. What you want to do is measure it out. Some egg plants are not all the same so make about four. Now, I'm just going to go right down just on the skin. It's really gonna help to get the salt in there. gonna help give a nice presentation. Of course my family they like to make a little Parmesan when we don't have enough chicken. So same thing, wanna even her out. One nip right on the side, straighten her out. I like to hold the end just gonna go down the line and that's how I like to do it.",
