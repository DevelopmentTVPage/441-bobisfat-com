    "transcripts": "This is the review for the Sport-Brella portable sun and weather shelter. This umbrella provides SPF of 125 sun protection. It comes with a carry bag that has a shoulder strap. You could set it up two ways. You can extend it upright like I have it now. Or you can have it leaning down on the ground. It has internal pockets where you can store things like your keys your cell phones or even the stakes. I'll show you the pockets now. Let's go underneath. As you could see we have pockets here. One on each side. We also have the two windows which help with airflow. We have one on this side and there's another on this side. As you can see standing upright, we have quite a bit of shade. \n\nThe main purpose for me buying this Sport-Brella was because our backyard is full of sun. It's nice to have a shady place to sit while the kids are playing outside or swimming in the pool. Now I am going to pause this video and I am going to set up the umbrella leaning on the ground. The sport-brella is now leaning on the ground which took me a total of 1 minute 10 seconds. As you can see there quite a bit of space. This is perfect fro going to the beach, sporting events, or just your backyard like we use it. I left the windows open. You can get a better sight of the pockets down here. Overall this is a wonderful product. We use it often. I love the fact that it has the SPF. The delivery was quick. There were no flaws in this product at all and I would definitely recommend it.",
