Which also explains why this tiny country has the largest number of Michelin-stared restaurants and chefs.\r\nFranck Giovannini and Stephane D\u00e9cotterd, two Michelin stars chef, guide us through this stiff competition that looks like a foretaste of the European selection ! \r\n\r\nLa comp\u00e9tition Suisse 2012\r\nAvec Franck Giovannini, St\u00e9phane Decotterd, Teo Chiaravalloti\r\nComme nous l'explique Franck Giovannini, bocuse de bronze et pr\u00e9sident du jury de la s\u00e9lection Suisse, c'est un pays \u00e0 part car il est \u00e0 la crois\u00e9e de chemins de trois grandes cultures culinaires : fran\u00e7aise, allemande et italienne. \r\nCe sont d'ailleurs ces influences et ce m\u00e9tissage qui font la force et la singularit\u00e9 de la Suisse qui, hormis en deux occasions, a toujours particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la finale des Bocuse d'Or. Cela explique d'ailleurs pourquoi ce si petit pays est \u00e9galement celui qui compte le plus grand nombre de restaurants et de chefs \u00e9toil\u00e9s. \r\nFranck Giovannini et St\u00e9phane D\u00e9cotterd, Chef doublement \u00e9toil\u00e9 au guide Michelin, nous guident \u00e0 travers cette finale aux allures de s\u00e9lection europ\u00e9enne et particuli\u00e8rement disput\u00e9e !",
