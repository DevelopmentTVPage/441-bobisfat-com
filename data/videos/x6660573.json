Over medium heat stir two tablespoons of cornstarch into one cup of white wine and mix until dissolved. slowly add shredded pepper jack and cheddar cheeses until beautifully melted. Then stir in diced green chilies until well combined. Rub the inside of the fondue pot with a peeled clove of garlic, then add the cheesy fondue. Then it's just a matter of what you dip into the fondue - I like giant croutons, oven roasted potatoes and brussel sprouts, even spicy bites of sausage. Simple, so find someone and share - Max, romantic music please - so find someone and share a melty, cheesy, romantic fondue.",
