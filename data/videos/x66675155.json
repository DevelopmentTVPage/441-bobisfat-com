Truly significant inventions. To make life easier, more enjoyable, and more convenient. they might look like small details but they always make big difference. Everyday, our scientists and engineers keep searching for them; for Braun products as well as other P&G brands just by asking hard questions. How can we down size a motor while boosting its performance? How can we design electronics that manage functions as well as errands? How can we uncover the frontier of technology to get beyond it? How can we see what meets the ear? How can we build quality components that last for decades? How can we do that faster than anyone else in the world. We can if we keep asking the questions of tomorrow. Developing ideas for the future and searching for the incredible.",
