So one of the top questions i get from celebrities editors and clients is how do i get my hair to grow longer? Here's some tips number one use a fortifying shampoo and conditioner the second tip avoid all heat that includes tools blow-dryers, flat irons, curly irons, hot rollers anything it really damages the ends and dries the ends of the hair out the third is used grow strong mask once a week with serramin it makes the hair 10 times stronger and the fourth one I would say is see your hairdresser every six weeks for a trim just to keep the dust off the ends so while hair is growing out it stays nice and strong.",
