    "transcripts": "This is the bin on my Dyson vacuum as you can see it's clear so you know when it needs to be emptied, you also know how much stuff your Dyson is picking up. You can kind of look at it and  get grossed out for a moment, but really you know you can see the effectiveness of the actual Dyson vacuum. The first time I used the bin on the Dyson vacuum I was elated, it is extremely easy to use. At just one click it's empty and then right back there. You'll see that it's full here from these max filled lines. It's actually very easy to dump it out, you don't get as dirty cause it's just one little small latch. You just click it empty it in the trash can, put it back in, you're off and rolling again. It's pretty amazing and it's kind of crazy to feel that way about a vacuum.",
