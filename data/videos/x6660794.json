    "transcripts": "Here's a simple and simply delicious change for Labor Day-- boneless country-style pork ribs. Start with the ribs. They have a wonderful combination of meat and fat. But trim any excess fat and then place them in a baking dish. In a small bowl, combine paprika, chipotle chili powder, celery salt, kosher salt, garlic and onion powders, fresh ground pepper, and brown sugar. Mix well and thoroughly coat the ribs. Then they go in the fridge for about an hour, up to three or four hours if you want. Just take them out. Let them come to room temperature before they go on the grill. Place them on a medium high grill. And cook about 15 to 20 minutes total, turning frequently until done where you like or to about 145 degrees. Then just slice and serve with anything. Oh. They make an amazing sandwich the next day too.",
