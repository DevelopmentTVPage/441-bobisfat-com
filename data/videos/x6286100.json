With this I can get more drinks with less prep work. It works with a patented two stage blade and auger system with a wide chute so you can turn just about any fruit or vegetable into a juice. Depending on which of the three pulp screens you use, you can get low pulp, high pulp, you can even use it to make sauces. Make healthy smoothies or add a fresh taste to your cocktails. I'm Tim Laird In the chef's corner with KitchenAid.",
