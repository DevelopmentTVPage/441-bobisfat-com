    "description": "The DYNATRAP offers a 3-way protection plan for insect elimination. First, UV fluorescent bulbs produce warm light to attract insects to the DYNATRAP. Second, an exclusive coating of titanium dioxide (TiO2) inside Dynatrap produces carbon dioxide (CO2), which is irresistible to mosquitos. Third, the insects are lured to the powerful vacuum fan, where they are collected and trapped into the retaining cage away from the area of usage providing the user safe pest protection and comfortable living quarters.",

Within a week you'll see a noticeable reduction. In six weeks with continuous 24\/7 operation you will have successfully broken the mosquito life cycle.

Many types of moths including the troublesome gypsy moth are a disruption to vegetation in the caterpillar stage of development they even destroy trees plants and vegetables in your garden. Dynatrap controls these flying pests. UV light from Dynatrap provides a warm attraction to flying insects. Carbon dioxide emitted from the unit mimics our breath creating an irresistible attraction. When insects approach Dynatrap's quiet powerful vacuum fan draws them into a retaining cage where they dry up and die. And unlike other mosquito traps which require placement at or near the breeding site Dynatrap can be placed anywhere within the entrapment area. Including areas of  human traffic. Stop Zapping. Start Trapping with Dyantrap.",
