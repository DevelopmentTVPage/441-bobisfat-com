The key to a better Buffet is all in the planning, and here's how I like to do it. First, determine if you want to put the table in the middle of the room alone in a crowd to use both sides. Or against the wall, great if you don't have a ton of space. Start with a tablecloth that fits the style of the Party, Place a big stack of plates at the buffets starting point, then plan the rest of your face layout. 1 tip, multiple levels created with beard serving pieces and pedestals can maximize space and gives the buffet visual appeal I like to use pretty wrapped box, just make sure it's stable. Pick a serving dish for each item on the Mania and designate a logical spot for everything. remember to put the condiments near the dishes that go with. Another tip, I'll ever every dish with a sticky note. This way I don't forget anything and I have all the serving pieces I need in place and ready to go away before the party. This includes chafing dishes trivets and a serving utensil for every single dish. Oh and don't forget something to rest the spoon on. One last secret, arrange silverware in a caddy all rolled up in a cloth napkin at the end of the table. That way the guests don't have to jiggle Forks and knives while they fill their plates. Take the time to set all this up tonight before the party you'll be glad you did. Now we're ready to feed a crowd the easy way.",
