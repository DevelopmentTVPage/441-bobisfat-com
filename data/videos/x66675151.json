    "transcripts": "[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nHi, I'm Marc Fosh and  today we're going to be making an easy pizza. So here we have the dough hook in the multi-quick and we're going to add flour, and a teaspoon of dried yeast, a little bit of salt, and we slowly add warm water to that mixture. You see how quickly that mixes the dough and the last thing we need to add is a little olive oil. So when it form a ball like that, we're ready to take it out. We're just going to out it on a flour surface and we just bring it together. So we work that through to make a nice dough. All we need to do is put that into a bowl, cover it in clean film and leave it to rest for about an hour and it will rise. Okay so for the topping of our pizza, we're going to make some sun dried tomatoes pesto with pine nuts, garlic cloves, and a little grated Parmesan, a little olive oil, put the top on, and we start to mince. Okay so now we have the pizza dough that's been resting for over an hour and we're ready to rolls out the pizza though. We we add a little bit of flour on the board. So we want a nice thin crisp pizza. Place the plate over the top, just cut around it. We're going to make this pizza with a nice pesto over the pizza as a base and we just spread it all over the base of the pizza. The other thing we're going to add it a little cherry tomatoes. Okay once we've dona that we can some mozzarella cheese and then we're going to finish with some basil. Put some fresh basil which we're just going to break up and the last thing is a little bit of grated Parmesan. We've got a really simple easy pizza and we pop that in the oven for about 20-25 minutes. Okay and there we have it. Pizza made easy with the Braun Multi-Quick perfect for a family style.",
