Hi I\u0092m Christie\u0085and let me tell you, the Miracle Mop truly is miraculous\u0085let me walk you through how it works.\r\n\r\nWhen you first get the mop, it looks like this. Notice that both of the locks are in their closed positions. To get started, unlock the mop. Start with the top lock by spinning the lock in the opposite direction of the arrow. Then, repeat on the lower handle.\r\n\r\n With both handles in the unlocked position let\u0092s soak the microfiber mop head. Now for the fun part, with one hand, pull the bottom spiral handle up so the mop head is in the elongated or extended position. Keep your hand on the bottom spiral and now with the top handle still unlocked, lift up until you feel tension or hear a click\u0085don\u0092t lift all the way up.\r\n\r\n Now push the top handle down while holding the mop head over the bucket\u0085now that\u0092s self-wringing technology!\r\n\r\n Just drop the lower handle and you\u0092re ready to mop. If you\u0092re a little taller, like I am, you can also adjust the mop height using the top handle. Find your desired length, lock it in place, and you\u0092re ready to go.\r\n\r\n We\u0092ve all been there\u0085using the same mop over and over until we have to throw it away. Well, not with the Miracle Mop! It\u0092s designed to be the last mop you\u0092ll ever need!\r\n\r\nHi I\u0092m Christie, let\u0092s go over how to remove and wash the microfiber mop head. Your mop should look like this\u0085in order to wash the Miracle Mop head, make sure both spiral handles are unlocked. Turn the mop upside down and find the latch. With your thumb, press down on the mop head and then use your fingers to pull the latch open. Remove the mop head by sliding it down the length of the pole handle, and voila! It\u0092s ready to wash.\r\n\r\nTo replace the mop head, insert the mop pole through the center of the mop head and slide the head all the way up. Make sure the plastic ring on the mop head is aligned with the open latch and push the mop head into the mop cup and close the latch. Then, slide the bottom section of the mop head onto the spiral handle.\r\n\r\n There! Good as new! Now you\u0092re ready to start using your \u0093new\u0094 Miracle Mop, no matter the mess!",
