    "transcripts": "[MUSIC PLAYING] I think interiors are so personal. These are all personal journeys. I mean it's how do you want to live and who are you living with and what kind of space and just into how you relate to each other. And that's particularly important for a new bride and a new groom. It is about joining two lives. But I think one thing that one learns through time is to trust one's self. If it represents you in a great way that's authentic and that's honest, then it's wonderful. \n\nAnd when it comes to my Wedgwood tabletop collection, we've taken into consideration the different lifestyles of people. Some people live in a very sleek and modern environment. Others live in a far more traditional space. And then there are people that have this eclectic blend. So even when I'm thinking of a Wedgwood china pattern, I'm thinking of how they're going to live. What surface is that plate going to sit on? Is it going to be on glass? Is it going to be on lacquer? Is it going to be on wood? And that kind of thinking is how I approach everything that I do. As you're living it, you're experiencing it. And one day, you'll look back on it. And you'll see where you came. And that's really what life is about. It's a metaphor for life.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]",
