It's possible you may have seen this cattle before it is the most requested OXO products for Hollywood sets. With the uplift OXO's development team struck the perfect balance between form and function. First and foremost we made the cattle safe and easy to use with the uplift all the interaction points are connected together allowing a user to open the kettle and pour simply by tilting the handle. The angle of the non slip handle is pointing away from the spout keeping your hands away from the scene. The handle also allows users to hold the uplift wherever comfortable, whether it is filled with water or nearly empty. The center opening his wide for easy filling and easy cleaning. The spout is also large enough to use for filling the kettle with water. All these elements help create the uplifts iconic shape. For example the connection between the spout and handle resembles a splash of water. Also the round body of the kettle was designed to maximize its capacity. All together the uplift is a functional elegant tool that graces the stove tops of Kitchens everywhere. The uplift kettle comes in stainless steel with a cork handle and a wide array of colors.",
