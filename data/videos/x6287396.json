    "transcripts": "I'm a kid from the projects I never saw a live cow until I was about 14 or. So I started to cover the transition back to half years ago I felt like there is a need for teaching young urban kids where their food comes from. To see them leave the classroom and to feel dignity and to feel like they accomplished something. I mean it's amazing. My technique for the hollandaise sauce that I just prepared is a classic or basic technique. There are many ways you can make it you can make it in a blender you can throw it in the c.b.d. and I just think it's really important to master the basics first. I feel like with hollandaise sauce you can add whatever you want. I put as a lead because I just thought it would go perfect with the asparagus salad on days but it's where it takes like 20 minutes but it's so fun to make and when it doesn't break your leg on my mind so I started using all clad 16 years ago. Oh I was the perfect weight in the handles were solid and then I went to complete induction and it is all tied again. Induction Brent. I'm the awkward girl life. I have it everywhere. And I love it.",
