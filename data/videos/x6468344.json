    "transcripts": "Welcome back to thanksgiving planning. This is where we help you have an organized, calm, and fun thanksgiving. At this point we\u2019re about two weeks out and now you can start your shopping. But I mean shopping for your non-perishables. Crispy onions, oils, canned items, that kind of stuff. Oh sure you can wait for the day before like so many other people but then it\u2019s just a madhouse but then it doesn\u2019t make any sense. Before you do shop, check your pantry to make sure you already don\u2019t own something. Because there\u2019s a very good chance you will. Okay, next, it\u2019s time to make room in your fridge and freezer. So the first days before thanksgiving comes you need room in your fridge and freezer. All that stuff is there now it\u2019s time to get rid of it. But I don\u2019t mean throw it out, I mean start using it up. The chicken that\u2019s chicken charitori, the left over whatever. Bring it out, start using it. You got a couple weeks. It\u2019s crazy not to. You got kids? Give it to the kids. They\u2019ll be so happy to have that. Finally, for this two weeks away from thanksgiving moment, you can start some cooking. And by cooking I don\u2019t mean turkey and mash potatoes. I mean things that will freeze well at this point. Pie doughs, soups, stuffs, many casseroles will be fantastic at this point. Alright before we leave, I promised you a little tease as to what to expect on real thanksgiving. And this weeks is the most delicious cranberry margarita. Next time we\u2019re only a few days away. It\u2019s getting so exciting. See Yah!",
