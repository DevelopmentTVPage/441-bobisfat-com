    "description": "You no longer need to choose between coffee or espresso\u2014with Nespresso's brewing breakthough, the VertuoLine, you can make both with one machine! The VertuoLine uses a new type of Nespresso capsule that has a bar code around the edge. This means that you just pop the capsule in and your VertuoLine machine reads the code and knows whether to brew coffee or espresso.\n\nInstead of using pressure to extract the coffee or espresso, VertuoLine uses something called Centrifusion Technology which means that it spins the capsule at up to 7,000 RPMs while water is injected into the capsule. The result is a flavor-rich extraction with a silky crema, even when you brew coffee! And the capsule? It's spun dry after the brewing process so your spent capsule container stays dryer and cleaner.",
