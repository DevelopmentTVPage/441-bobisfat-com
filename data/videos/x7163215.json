OXO's compact toilet brush and canister is the perfect addition to any size bathroom no matter how small. The unique canister design allows the toilet brush to be stored within easy reach. Simply lift the brush, and the canister door automatically opens. The shape of the handle is comfortable to hold and the brush head features durable bristles and a tapered shape for deep cleaning. After cleaning simply,  replace the brush and the canister for neat, compact, and sanitary storage. A built in drip tray in the canister bottom catches excess water and allows it to quickly evaporate. Here's a good tip. Use a second brush set to scrub inside tall kitchen garbage cans.",
