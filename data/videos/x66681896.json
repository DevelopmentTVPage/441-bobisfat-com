    "transcripts": "Hi, as a dental hygienist I get asked a lot how to get the best out of your toothbrush. When some one buys a Sonic here there's a certain movement and if you use it a certain way you get the clean fresh feeling all day long. The toothbrush has a movement from side to side which make it quite unique and different from a manual brush. You get the best out of it and get  a clean feeling all day long. You need to angle the brush up towards the gum line or down towards the gum line when you're brushing. \n\nSo when you're brushing, if you brush straight into the tooth, it will clean the tooth but not as well if you brush at an angle towards the gum line touching the tooth and where the gum meet this makes the fluid move above the teeth hat kills more bacteria. When you're brushing , you angle the brush towards the gum line and then you just gently and lightly hold for a few seconds on each tooth. \n\nThere will be a beep of thirty seconds which will tell you to finish the back quadrant then two minutes and the brush will switch off completely. When you're holding your brush you should try not to grasp too hard because the movement needs to be light so that the fluid can move so you just hold it lightly and bring the angle up towards the gum  or down. When you're putting in toothpaste on your brush you only need to use a small pea sized amount and don't switch your brush on until you got your brush in your mouth remember to angle towards the gum and touching where the tooth and gum meet and switch on. Then you repeat the same on every quadrant until the brush switches off and have a nice clean feeling all day long.",
