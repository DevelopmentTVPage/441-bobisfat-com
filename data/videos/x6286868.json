    "transcripts": "It's a whole grilling fish is just a fond memory of mine. Every Friday, Saturday and Sunday till it got too cold for me to pull up that anger would all wake up we'd all get on the boat go fishing come back buckets fill bluefish and then you know even from a little kid I was the guy that had a beautiful job of scaling getting them ready to throw over an open flame. We're looking at fish that are going to be anywhere between one to tops two pounds for the home cook. First you have to preheat the grill the other thing is you don't want any moisture on the protein when you're putting it on the grill going to make two small incisions on the back bone of either side of the fish. And these incisions really are for helping you cope with the fish once it's cooked on the grill. It's you're probably looking at a total of around 12 minutes. So it's three minutes and then turn for three minutes. Three minutes and then turn it again for three minutes. If you notice you've got a really lot of car on this I know it seems very aggressive but what you're not seeing is that there's this much flash on the other side and you really want to get that sharp flavor. That we're going to remove it and allow it to rest close by the need for probably a seven or eight minutes. Open it. Take those bones out. A little extra virgin olive oil a little bit of lemon juice some salt and pepper. It's not food is art necessarily it's more about food can create a memory.",
