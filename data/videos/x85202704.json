    "transcripts": "This video will show how quick and easy it is to properly assemble your Bone Hardwood Floor Mop. Follow these easy steps:\n\nOpen the box and remove all five pieces. Connect the handle to the lower pole by aligning the guide from the lower pole to the channel on the upper handle. Make sure you use light force until you hear the pieces snap into place. Then slide the green collar up into the handle aligning the channels. Attach the mop base to the bottom of the pole by aligning the channel and rotating the base until the silver button snaps into place. Lay the Bona microfiber cleaning pad on the floor with the blue side down. Firmly place the mop base on top of the pad to secure it. Remove the cap from the refillable mop cartridge and place the cartridge into the mop by pushing down until it clicks into place. Pull the trigger 3 - 4 times to fill the reservoir. Once full, the spray will dispense. If the mob is not spraying properly, try setting the cartridge by lifting it out and firmly pressing it back down making sure the cartridge snaps into place. You're now ready to use your Bona Hardwood Floor Mop. Clean, shine, and protect with Bona.",
