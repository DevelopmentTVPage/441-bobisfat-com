In order to do that, I'm going to roll the basil into a cigar shape and I'm going to use my chef knife here today. You're gonna take your knife like this. This gives you a lot of control and then just simply do a rocking motion. It's important that your knife is really sharp when using basil because it's such a delicate herb. Luckily these Calphalon knives come with self sharpening blocks. Another method for the basil is to do a chop. And I'm just gonna cut across. Maybe about quarter inch slices. This application I might use in a tomato sauce. So you see I've turned my basil and I'm just simply gonna go across the other direction. And here we have our basil. A chiffonade and a chop.",
