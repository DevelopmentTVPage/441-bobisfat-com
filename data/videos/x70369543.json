Start by taking out the serving pieces you've already decided on and a quick test run is always a good way to make sure they fit where and how you want. This is also a great time to figure out who sit where, remember Aunt Ruth and Cousin Leon from last year pretty sure you don't want that again. Get your knife sharpening out of the way cause you'll have much more important stuff to do next week. This is also the perfect time to shop for your non perishables. Make and freeze any soups you are going to have and if you need a suggestion check out the blog for the roasted poblano or curry pumpkin soup there both great. And remember a frozen turkey takes about five hours a pound to thaw in the fridge. Planning and prep are really the key, you do a little bit each day and you will be in great shape for a great Thanksgiving.",
