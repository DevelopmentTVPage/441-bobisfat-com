    "transcripts": "Hi I'm Nancy from bed bath and beyond and I'm here to tell you about the fridge bins organization system. This unique system helps you organize and maximize the space in your fridge. These versatile pieces. Let you create. Customized storage and make the most of every inch they make your fridge simple to navigate and the food easy to find. These three organizers can be used in many combinations to fit your storage needs. There is deep as the average fridge shelf. So there is no wasted space in front or back. Like pieces can stack so you can store food so you don't need daily. And they have convenient handles. I love that these pieces are clear so I can see what's inside. It makes putting together my shopping list much easier. Once I organize my fridge with a system those little yogurt containers and juice boxes stop disappearing. Now my fridge is as organized as my closets. The fridge bins organization system is available online and out of bed bath and beyond storage near you.",
