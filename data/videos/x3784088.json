Preheat Oven to 275\u00b0F (135\u00b0C)\n2.  Place all Oreo cookies into food processer and process until you have reached fine crumbs.\n3.  Remove 1 \u20443 of the crumbs and reserve for later use. Place cubed butter into food processor with remaining crumbs and process just until you have reached a dough consistency.\n4.  Line cupcake pan with cupcake papers and distribute the Oreo dough evenly into each of the cupcake papers (about 1 tablespoon each). Press the dough down onto the bottom of each of the papers making sure the bottoms are covered evenly \u00bc\" thick as this will be the crust of each cupcake. Refrigerate while mixing other ingredients.\n5.  Place cream cheese, sugar, vanilla extract and 2 tablespoon of Oreo cookie crumbs into mixer and mix on speed 8 until smooth.\n6.  Reduce mixer speed to 3 and add heavy whipping cream, pinch of salt and eggs (add eggs slowly one by one) just until incorporated. Try not to over mix the batter.\n7.  Remove crusts from refrigerator and fill each cupcake with batter almost to the top.\n8.  Place in oven for 20-22min (rotate pan half way through) cook until centers have slight jiggle. Turn oven off and crack open oven door and allow cupcakes to cool. (This prevents cracking.) Remove from oven and sprinkle crumbs on tops of cupcakes.  Then refrigerate for at least 3 hours before serving.  Enjoy!  --Betty  :)",
