Using a v formation you can cut the root tip out and then straight across on the sprout tip. Peel it back using your finger nail. So following those vertical lines, we're gonna slice forward. The sharper the knife, the less you cry. Cutting toward your palm, you're gonna go through the middle. Switch over to the top. The other side of the onion we'll do a Julienne following again those vertical lines, but all the way through. Once you get about two thirds of the way through the onion, it's helpful to flip it. We have an onion two ways, medium dice and Julienne",
