    "description": "Dive into adventure! The Lil\u2019 Ocean Explorers 3- in- 1 Adventure Course stimulates and entertains your baby throughout 3 key developmental milestones: sitting, crawling and standing. When sitting, baby gets tactile with features like the submarine Peek-A-Boo door, the marine wall, ball drop periscope and multiple clicker knobs. When crawling, watch as your baby explores and discovers new ways to play with the different features of the adventure course. When standing, your baby will hear sounds and phrases from their new octopus friend and will be encouraged to play and run when the octopus throws balls! Each play station on the Lil\u2019 Ocean Explorers Adventure Course is interchangeable and removable. Perfect for kids 6 -36 months.\n\nLittle Tikes, Imaginations in Motion!\n\n@LittleTikes +LittleTikes #LittleTikes #ImaginationsInMotion",
