    "description": "A quick video demonstration of the NewAir WAT10W Water Bottle. See how easy it is to use and why it\u2019s the best water cooler accessory you can buy.\n\nThe NewAir WAT10W Water Bottle is a replacement for ordinary plastic jugs. Instead of relying on pre-filtered water, the WAT10W filters the water itself using an activated carbon filter. As you pour tap water in to the top, it percolates down to the bottom. Chlorine, sediment, and pollutants in the water get pulled out as it passes through the filter, leaving nothing but clean, healthy drinking water for you to enjoy. Best of all, it can be refilled without taking it off the water cooler. No more lifting heavy water jugs.\n\nThe WAT10W is also a money saver. Tap water costs less than a penny per gallon, compared to $1.20-$1.40 per gallon for bottled water. That\u2019s a savings of hundreds of dollars per year for the average home; thousands of dollars a year for an office.\n\nThe WAT10W is made from 100% BPA-free plastic, to protect your health, like all of NewAir\u2019s water dispensers and accessories. We\u2019re committed to the highest standards of safety and quality.",
