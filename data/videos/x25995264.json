And if you don't cook a lot, that idea might stress you out. That's why I'm here with a delicious and simple stuffed French toast. Slice a French loaf about an inch and a half thick. Then use a knife to make a pocket in the middle. Stuff it with softened cream cheese and raspberry jam. Okay so while I'm using raspberry jam feel free to use whatever you like. Though I gotta say raspberry jam really is the way to go. Beat eggs in a bowl, and add a little milk and sugar. Dip both sides of the stuffed bread into the egg mixture and cook in a buttered, non-stick surface until golden brown on both sides. Remove, cut in half, sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve. And if you can't make it for your mom, find a mom to make it for, she will be do appreciative.",
