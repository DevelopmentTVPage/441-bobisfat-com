    "transcripts": "Yes our this is Ian from Hoover. I saw your email I want to show you how to perform routine maintenance on your links handheld vacuum after the dirt cup becomes full just twisted off counter-clockwise like so. Remove the filters and dump the dirt cup out into the waste basket. If the filters look dirty just rinse the foam filter under warm water and let it dry for 24 hours and if it becomes torn or lost click on this link below to order a new one. The red plastic cyclon filter can be rinsed as well and allow to air dry right next to your phone filter. Hope this helps if you have any questions or comments. Just let us know on Facebook, Twitter or email me directly at Ian's at McCormick at care dot com.",
