Oil coming out legends and which other vacuums leave behind. We've also got a very high efficiency separation system and if we look here there are 12 planes or spin the end very very quickly and quite incredible forces. To capture the tiniest particles. If you look at this machine it doesn't actually have any secondary stage high speed. Cyclonic separation and as a consequence it has to rely heavily on this horse fell into the trap that fine dust.",
