When you're cutting number its important to be able to have a blade that can cut all different types of materials, last long and not chip when you are using it. Compared to other blades that I've used the wall 2x long life blade was very easy to cut very smooth nice straight line didn't pull the left in polar right and when I was carrying the four-by-four pressure-treated piece of lumber there are some nails in it and it just blows right through it with these with Smith house instruction we have several carpenters were going through a lot of blades all the time its nice now that we have a blade that we can now use on a regular basis and go to every time for any type of material we need.",
