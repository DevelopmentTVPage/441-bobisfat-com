    "transcripts": "Now I'm going to show you how to make the iced version of my favorite drink, a traditional cappuccino. So, we're going to steam some milk, just for the foam, and we're going to pull a double shot of espresso with a little bit of cold milk and the foam over ice. First, we're going to start by grinding the beans. Then, we're going to take our dry, preheated portafilter, and we're going to dose out some coffee. Give it a nice, firm tamp. Make sure there are no grinds along the edges. Alright, now we're going to steam our milk for our foam. We're going to just remove the froth enhancer today. We're going to get nice, silky foam. We're going to purge the water out of the steam wand first, so just turn it to the \"On\" setting. Alright. As the milk starts to rise, because the foam is being created, you're going to have to pull your pitcher down with it. Stay right on the surface of the milk. Alright. Always remember to clean your steam wand right after you use it. So, now we're ready to pull our espresso. We're going to take our portafilter, insert it, put it into the locked position. Take our preheated cups to catch the espresso, and we'll hit \"Double Shot\". Alright. So, because we're working with the hot foam and the hot espresso, we've got to be very delicate with the ice. Give the foam a little stir, and we're going to spoon it on top and cool it off with some milk. And, we'll get some espresso, some more foam. The most important part is the foam, because we want to replicate the traditional cappuccino ratio. We're going to finish it off, and there you have it: the perfect summer cappuccino.",
