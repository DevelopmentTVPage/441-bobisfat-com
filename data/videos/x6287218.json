    "transcripts": "Hi Ron this is Ian from Hoover. I saw your review on Amazon and think we know what's going on with the airport there's too little on the dark up should snap easily into your handle when the filter is aligned correctly. Here's how to check make sure that the curve portion with the screens faces up and slides closest to the Hoover logo. Then snap it into the handle portion by aligning it with the Hoover logo and the release button. Next place the hand back tip into this portion of the lower nozzle to snap the handle back in now when you roll the power switch or two and one should turn on. Slide the power switch down once more to activate the bus for the carpet scenario. Hope this helps if you need more help feel free to reach out to us via Facebook, Twitter or email me personally at Ian's at McCormick at floor care dot com.",
