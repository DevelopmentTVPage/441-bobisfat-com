The reserve narrator is designed to aerate an entire bottle of wine in under 30 seconds. The German-made carafe also includes a topper that integrates the reserve aerator like all Vinturi red wine aerators. The reserve aerator infuses the air as you pour bringing out the wines intended flavor and bouquet instantly whether you're pouring an entire bottle among friends are enjoying a glass yourself. Here's how it works I'm going to set my Vinturi reserve red wine aerator into the craft topper, make sure the wine is at the halfway point of the bowl to maintain pressure and to avoid leakage through the air holes. Now I'm going to pour the red wine. Hear that, that sound is unique to Vinturi aerators and you know your Vinturi is working when you hear that sound. The reserve red wine aerator can be purchased separately without the carafe I love hosting parties and doing before and after taste test the results are simply amazing. Make the Vinturi reserve red wine aerator and carafe set an essential part of your bar wear and all of your special occasions think outside the glass it's all about the bottle, enjoy.",
