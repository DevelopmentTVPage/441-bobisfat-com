Kamal Rahal Essoulami, pr\u00e9sident des \u00e9quipes nationales des m\u00e9tiers de Bouche, qui a r\u00e9unit un Comit\u00e9 compos\u00e9 des meilleurs chefs marocains.\r\n\r\nPour les 10 candidats s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s et, plus encore, pour le gagnant,\r\nc'est un r\u00eave qui se r\u00e9alise, une v\u00e9ritable reconnaissance. Le Maroc va\r\nenfin pouvoir se mesurer aux grandes nations de la gastronomie et porter\r\nhaut ses couleurs.\r\n\r\nD'autant que, comme le souligne Florent Suplisson, Directeur des Bocuse\r\nd'Or, la participation du Maroc n'est qu'une premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape du d\u00e9ploiement \r\ndu concours sur le continent africain.\r\n\r\nAu programme : une comp\u00e9tition riche en couleurs, en saveurs et en\r\n\u00e9motions.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nDespite a rich gastronomic culture, this is the first time that Morocco\r\nholds a national selection of the Bocuse d'Or.\r\n\r\nThis participation is mainly due to Kamal Rahal Essoulami, president of the national \r\nteams \"des m\u00e9tiers de Bouche\", who has formed a special committee with the best Moroccan chefs. \r\n\r\nFor the 10 contestants and, even more so, for the winner of this\r\nselection, it simply is a dream come true, a tremendous recognition.\r\nMorocco will finally have a chance to rival with the greatest culinary\r\nnations and defend its colours.\r\n\r\nAnd, as Florent Suplisson, Director of the Bocuse d'Or, indicates,\r\nMorocco only is a first step towards the opening of the competition to the\r\nAfrican continent.\r\n\r\nOn the menu of this episode : rich colours, flavors and emotions.",
