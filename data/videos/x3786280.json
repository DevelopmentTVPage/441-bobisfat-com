Easy to load and easy to serve, the PartyPopper includes a unique measuring cup for adding the perfect amount of oil and kernels every time. Just load, pop, and serve right from the bowl. \n\nTo use, place the upper bowl on top of the lower bowl. Insert the handle into the side. Pour oil and kernels into the measuring cup and add to the kettle. Insert the kettle into the base and latch into place. Lower the cover and turn on. When done, the top lifts off and the base functions as a serving bowl. \n\nThe dishwasher safe kettle is easily removable for no hassle cleanup. And the top and bottom separate and nest together for easy storage. Let the Hamilton Beach PartyPopper Popcorn Maker do all the work while you enjoy your party. Now that's good thinking.",
