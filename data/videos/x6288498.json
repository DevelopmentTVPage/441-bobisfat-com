My name is Patrick and we are here backstage as he told autumn winter 2015 collection check. This collection started where a series of posts written by a let's go to a local Douglas who lives in Holland in 1,600 and wrote poems about the street I'm with you live so the inspiration behind all of the quote is very much the feeling that you get from reading these and then we use the photographs of the fantastic the topical we go to third very late 50 hair reference the boys are completely clean shaven. We're backstage now it's all pretty just done our rehearsal which went well. Yeah it's good I think at this point. I'm for began as a museum wrong crucified clich\u00e9s going to trimming down all the fish. To start with the trimming always followed the natural growth of the hair. And then eventually when we're going to share it we can go against that. As otherwise you would put them on the head. Now we're going to go back.

So always work against the natural growth and I'll find it by itself it's not pulling to mind and I think also what's good about this brothers was us with them so you can use underneath the shower. We have a. Nice slick and clean shaven. And clear some of the synergy between what we do not just because the grooming regime is vitally important to the way the show looks it's about beautiful design and precise engineering everything that you see in here in the show is important to the way we tell the story.",
