    "transcripts": "Looking for turkey excellence? who isn't?. I mean we all want the Norman Rockwell Thanksgiving table. There are a handful of tools to make your turkey quest a lot easier. We'll start with the marinade injector. And whether you use homemade or store-bought marinate, you just fill it and inject flavor through the bird. Think of it as marinade that works from the inside. Next up is the V rack to set the bird on. This lets it get all the way around for perfect cooking. and then a heavy duty roasting pan means even Heating and sturdiness. Once cooking, I use a ball baster for, yes you guessed it, basting. They just make dealing with a hot bird and a hot pan so much quicker and easier than a spoon. and when it comes to temperature, I like an outside the oven thermometer. There's no opening the door to check and therefore no heat loss. And they're accurate, and I like accurate. And some even come with a remote receiver so you don't have to be anywhere near the turkey when it's ready, imagine that. And perhaps one of the most overlooked but important pieces, turkey lifters. When you need to be certain your turkey makes the trip from pan to cutting board without falling, lifters are the answer. And speaking of a cutting board, get one big enough to hold the turkey, but also has it that little rough around the edges to catch the juices. A little planning and the right tools and everything will be fine.",
