    "transcripts": "panini presses are very popular today. Turn an every day sandwich into an authentic cafe style gourmet meal with the Breville panini duo. Allow the press to  pre heat its 1500 watts of power while it's closed and then when the light illuminates green you're ready to go.  The panini duo has adjustable height control which allows you to fix the top plate in a range positions above the bottom plate. This allows your panini press to be used as an open toaster ideal for toasting open sandwich style melts. For the traditional panini, the floating hinge let's the top plate sit completely horizontal for even grilling and the top plate is ribbed with those signature grill marks while the bottom is flat for even cooking and toasting\/ The plates are non-stick for easy cleanup just wipe the paper towel up and down. Toasting should take anywhere from five to eight minutes and will depend on your preference and the type of bread you use. The higher the sugar content, the quicker it will brown. But the panini duo is not limited to sandwiches. The flat bottom plate is hot enough for cooking items such as eggs and pancakes. The panini duo another great innovation by Breville",
