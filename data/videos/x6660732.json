    "transcripts": "When it's time for a shave, I want ultimate shaving performance and skin comfort. After powering up my Braun shaver, I hold it at a 90 degree angle to my face. The Braun Series 9 is a fully flexible shaving system, which adapts to every contour of my face. Even problem areas such as the chin, neck, or jaw line are easy to shave. The easy pop up long hair trimmer gives me perfect precision on my sideburns. \n\nI can groom with foam or gel, or during a refreshing shower. That's no problem with Braun Series 9. Ultimate performance for perfectly smooth skin. \n\nThe best way to clean my shaver is with a Braun clean and charge station. Without one, I can clean my Braun shaver with a brush or under hot running water. And occasionally, add a little oil to the cutting parts. \n\nI change the cutting system cassette about every 18 months. And change the cleaning center refill about once a month, or when the level indicator blinks red. To maintain 100% of my shaver's performance.",
