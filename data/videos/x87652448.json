    "transcripts": "Hi I'm Marcy with Unfi, Mrs. Meyers cleaning day makes uncomplicated products for a clean and happy home. In fact everything Mrs. Meyers makes is auromatheraputic  which is just a fancy way of saying healthy and good. The new 4x laundry detergent is remarkably consentrated, just 1 34oz bottle  packs in 68 loads of laundry, that's just one tablespoon per load. More loads per bottle with less detergent means less plastic, less water, and less energy used in transportation load by load, waste not want not. Hard working naturally derived ingredients and essential oils are tough on dirt, yet gentle on fabrics and the earth. Of course this formula works in high efficiency and conventional machines. The handy flip top cap provides an easy way to pretreat stains, simply dab detergent on the stain when it's still fresh and new, let it set for 3-10 minutes, then wash as directed, that was easy.",
