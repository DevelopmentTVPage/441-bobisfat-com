The easy-to-clean silicone basket traps food debris to prevent clogs. To empty the Strainer, simply pick it up by the center post and invert the silicone basket for easy debris removal. To stop the sink to fill it with water, just give the large, comfortable knob a quarter turn in any direction and the Stopper drops down for soaking dishes or pans. You'll know that you've gone from strain to stop or vice versa when the post clicks into place. A silicone underside won't scratch the sink basin.",
