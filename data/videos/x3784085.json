Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.  Rinse the sweet potatoes under water to wash off dirt.  (See Green Regimen's Video on \"How to wash your Fruits and Vegetables\")   Place the sweet potatoes on the lined baking sheet and spread it out evenly.  Place in oven on the middle rack for 90 minutes.  Times may vary depending on the size of your potatoes.  Let cool until warm to the touch.  Peel the skin off the potatoes and place into a large mixing bowl.  The skin should peel off easily if they are fully cooked.  Use a potato masher to mash the sweet potatoes until the consistency is smooth without any lumps remaining.  The sweet potatoes can keep in the freezer for up to 10 months when stored in a heavy duty freezer bag.",
