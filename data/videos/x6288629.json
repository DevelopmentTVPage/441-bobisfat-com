The pack and play with reversible napper and changer from Graco. First off, I love this pack in play because it grows with my child from infancy all the way up to the toddler stage.

The changing table provides time saving convenience so you don't have to make a mad dash to the nursery for diaper changes. Best of all the changer features wipe clean fabric that makes cleanup a snap. And a secure attachment allows for a safe and simple switch from napper to changer and back again. It also has a removable full sized bassinet that provides an ideal spot for your infant to nap. The toy bar feature soft plush toys to amuse your little one while providing visual stimulation. Transitioning to toddler play yard mode is so easy and the airy mesh provides great ventilation. Plus the Graco signature push button fold makes closing your play yard quick and hassle free.
