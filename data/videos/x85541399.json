Moist to a point where I thought maybe I forgot to rinse off. It felt amazing oh my do I love a good coconut scent [Music] now as far as performance it does exactly what it says pure magic, didn't know that was possible in just three minutes but yes yes it is. You won't be able to stop touching it, what when something this quickly leaves you so satisfied you'd rave about it to Aussies three minute miracle moist deep conditioner give it a squeeze and tell us how you liked it.
