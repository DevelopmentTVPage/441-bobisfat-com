The problems with existing robots are that they have very poor suction and don\u2019t navigate properly, so they don\u2019t make very good vacuum cleaners*.                                           Dyson engineers have been busy developing a unique 360 vision system that lets the Dyson robot see where it is, where it has been and where it has yet to clean. Vision, combined with Dyson digital motor and cyclone technologies are the key to a high performing robot vacuum.

We've developed a high speed digital meter which combined with a powerful cyclons gives this very powerful suction. In fact it's the first robot vacuum capable of high performance clean but crucially it has this 360 degree vision system so they can see all the way around. This means that they can see where it's been and you can see where it's going so that it navigates properly it has a measure rise brush law which spans are full with with stiff bristles to remove ground and from carpets and soft carbon fiber filaments to remove fine dust from hard floors. Is there any robot with continuous tank tracks. This means does it maintain speed and direction across all surfaces will bring together all this technology that makes an intelligent robot that cleans your home properly. No",
