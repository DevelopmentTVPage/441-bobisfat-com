The Slow-MO guys did a video, Rooster Teeth made a video,  and now it's my turn. I'm here at echo park and I have a blue berry smoothie with me and I'm gonna bump into some strangers and spill it all over myself and blame it on them and see how they react. So let's see how this works.\n\nGUY: Dude are you okay?\n\nANDREW: I'm sorry. NO you gotta watch we're you're going bro. My shirt's all dirty now becasue of you. Are you gonna buy me a new shirt.\n\nGUY: I'm not gonna buy you a new shirt.\n\nANDREW: Are you gonna buy me a new shirt?\n\nGUY: Neither one of us is gonna buy you a new shirt man.\n\nANDREW: Well you guys.\n\nGUY:  Have a goof day.\n\nANDRE: Sorry can you just hold this for a sec. Alright thank you. Oh gosh. Oh come on.\n\nGIRL: Oh are you okay?\n\nANDREW: Oh shoot. \n\nGIRL: Rude! \n\nANDREW: Are you kidding me. Can you look we're your going. Well now you have to give me your number or something. What are you gonna do now?\n\nGIRL: Mom, I;m gonna call you back. I could get some napkins.\n\nANDREW: No. \n\nMAN: What was that? \n\nANDREW: I was like on my phone. I'm sorry dude.\n\nMAN: Unbelievable, unbelievable .\n\nANDREW: Dude it didn't even get on you. I didn't get any on you dude.You own me a shirt. \n\nMAN: I owe you a shirt?!\n\nANDREW: Yeah.\n\nMAN: I owe you a shirt?!
