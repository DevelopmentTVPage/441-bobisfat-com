The problem I have two words for you gravy separator: it's simple you just pour your pan drippings into a separator and you have a start to amazing gravy at the bottom separated from the grease on top. Boom, alright Kyle it's my first thanksgiving how do I make it go smoothly because not everyone gets along. Good question I would say the key to this is a seating plan make it as festive and cordles create cute place cards at each seating and seat everyone  so no one has a chance to push anyone buttons. Number two: Do I need a roasting rack fro my turkey. If you want a good turkey then yes",
