    "description": "Everybody\u2019s definition of \u201cperfect\u201d toast is a little different. Some like it dark, some light, and others somewhere in between. The OXO 2-Slice and 4-Slice Motorized Toasters have nine digital settings, allowing everyone to find their perfect shade. Want more control? The LED countdown shows exactly how much time is left, but our take-a-peek feature lets you check in on the toasting progress mid-cycle; the \u201ca little extra\u201d function will give you extra toasting if you want it. Defining \u201cperfect\u201d toast is up to you; delivering it is up to us!",
