Hamilton beach big mouth pro six 7\/6\/08 one. Looks like this. I have taken it all apart it's pretty much all plastic so this is the actual base and then these are all the parts so I washed how much you drive them. I also whatever I like a hash tag juicing on Instagram all the pictures of people with their juice in jars so I just got a set of these jars I mean there's 12 of them there's only $10. I thought that was really nice. So I'm going to put it together and then I'll come back and show you guys what I'm going to try for my first. Two c so is it. OK so I have my juicing things I really don't know how much she use to me using three things of celery some carrots a really old pair and then an apple just like a cheap apple that I could find. Oh you can't do that here. Oh and a. I mean do you see every morning. OK so here's what we have oh it's cool it's like it's like carrot celery. I hope this is so I got it so like you see looking good. Yeah wound like. This beauty. So OK. So you hold this and watch me try the difference. OK so this is my carrot celery. Pear apple juice I don't want you to walk to puke. Deal less if that is good cause. I think it might be more like characters. Maybe because you put like three karats inside. And only want to help. Them do too much. Of it went right. Isn't she a pretty girl. When you see this guy. I might do more. Taste like carrot put in juice. Yes it is sad it does he's like celery. Oh yeah like yeah. OK so this was my first use 30 character and now I'm going to clean this mobo. All my life he cares for me so annoying.",
