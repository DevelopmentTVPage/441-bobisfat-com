    "transcripts": "Memorial Day - a day filled with traditions of family, friends, and food cooked outside. Unfortunately, it's often the same food cooked every year - and I'm here to say it's time for a change. So today we're making Stuffed Teriyaki Pineapple Burgers. Start by putting ground beef in a burger press and use the pocket attachment to make and  indentation in the burger. Add sauteed red onion and Swiss cheese. Cover with remaining ground beef, and seal. Season well with salt and pepper and place on a greased heated grill. with pineapple slices. Once you flip the burger, brush with teriyaki sauce along with the pineapple slices. Adding any kind of sweet sauce too early can cause everything to burn - and we don't want that. So wait until you flip before adding it. Grill until the burger is done and the pineapple slices are gorgeous. Remove from grill and add buns for toasting. Then just build the burger. Memorial Day - I say it's time for a new tradition.",
