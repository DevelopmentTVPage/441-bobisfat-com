    "transcripts": "You need food for the football game of all football games. And as usual, I'm here for you with two recipes. Add hot sauce to melting butter in a small pot and put in some shredded, deli-roasted chicken. Stir and set aside. Spread blue cheese dressing on a pizza crust. Then add the chicken mixture and top with shredded mozzarella. Bake at 425 until bubbly and gorgeous, about 15 minutes. \n\nBut wait, don't stop there. While it bakes, brush store-bought pesto on skewered shrimp and cook in a hot grill pan until done. And whether your team wins or loses, your food is still going to be great.",
