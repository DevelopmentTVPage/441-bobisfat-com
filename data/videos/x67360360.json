You want to use a true knife, a chef's knife, very sharp, because it will let the knife do the work. Put it up nice and flat. So let's cut it in half. You can try to go all the way across if you're knife is a little longer but the safer way is to do half and half. Rotate it all the way. Let's do the same thing on this side. Nice, now we have to sides and I'm going to work with one. Now we want to cut it right down the center just let the knife do the work. Now I like to work with the inside out so you can get your knife in there. Now, If you want to do some dice, let's go corner to corner. Nice and easy no mess. If you want it nice and chunky, just go across. Alright so that's how I like to do my watermelon. Got my slices, my wedges, and my cubes.",
