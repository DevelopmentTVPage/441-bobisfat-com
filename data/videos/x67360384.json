First cut we're going to do is a wide cut that's good for sauteing    this. It's important to keep your fingers curled back when using this chef's knife. It's a big blade, it's heavy, it's sharp, you don't want to cut yourself. So just making wide cuts. The next cut we're going to do is a chiffonade. Chiffonade is a very fine cut. So here we have our two finished cuts. We have a chiffonade, great for salads, and here we have a wide cut food for sauteing and a side dish.",
