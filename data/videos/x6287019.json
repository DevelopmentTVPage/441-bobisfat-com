    "transcripts": "This is Ian from Hoover. I saw your question on Walmart Canada's website and I have a good idea what's going on when your rewind turns off like that. It's usually due to a clogged. Here's what to do. Check the indicator at the top of your cup. If it's read there's something restricting air flow. Here's how to fix it. Start by removing your cup flip the lid open and check your filter here. Be sure to check its underside. If it's dirty rinse it under warm water and allow 24 hours for it to dry. Make sure you set it up on its head so it dries evenly even if you regularly rinse it placing a filter that's not fully dry back into the dirt cup could clog the filter even easier. Next check your main hose for clogs. Remove your hose here and here and use a broom handle to knock out any debris that may be stuck in there. Now there's one more spot you can see if those two are clear and you still don't have strong suction. The lower hose. Remove the hood and then take out the brass role and now check your lower hose for obstructions you can use a grabber tool to dislodge any clocks. Let us know if you need more help via Facebook, Twitter or email me personally at the end. Maccormack at floor care dot com.",
