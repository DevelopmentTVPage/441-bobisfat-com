Very important to have a sharp knife, especially as you take this outside layer off. Now that we have our pineapple cleaned, we're going to quarter it. All we have to do there is go straight down and then we're going to half these. Now we have quarters. Now to remove the core, we're just going to remove at an angle going straight down. Take one of these and we're going to cut it into a large dice. What we'll do with these guys, we're going to use a rocking motion with your fingers tucked back. This last piece what we're going to do is cut it just a little smaller. Once we have it here, nice slices. Okay here's out pineapple three ways, we have a large dice for a salad. we have a slice for a fruit tray, and a small dice for a chef.",
