I'm an incoming freshman, and Jess here has been helping me setup my room. >>Now, Nicole, are you ready to start studying? >>Oh, yeah, I guess that's one of the things you're supposed to do here. >>Yeah. And if you want to make it a more pleasant experience, you have to make your work-space work for you. And I see you got the desk chair. It's built for working at a desk, and your back will thank you for it. And a lot of people forget to bring a desk lamp, but I see you have one of those, too. And you'll able to see everything on your desk. >>Yeah. I mean that's gonna be great for when I do manicures at my desk, right? >>Well, yeah, that, too. And it's a good thing you thought of bringing a book case because they don't always provide them. >>Yeah. I saw my book list and I was like \"I definitely need a book case\". >>And I'm thinking you're probably going to do a lot of your homework right on your bed. >>Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. So, I actually got this thing. It gives me light where ever I need it. And I got this laptop cooling pad, which keeps my laptop from getting too hot. And my thighs. >>Nice. >>Oh, and this lamp here? I bought that, too. I like it so much better than the overhead lights in the room. >>Yes it's nice to have a floor lamp, too. You don't want to be squinting at your textbooks. >>Or your manicure. >>Hmm, now that you mention it...",
