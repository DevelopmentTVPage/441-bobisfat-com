Land of extraordinary legends filled with brave and enchanting heroes.\nVictorinox Swiss Army is reviving, in its own inimitable way, three Swiss stories emblematic of this land's heritage. Follow the new adventures of these famous heroes, as they confront the unexpected realities of the modern world. \nThree myths, three stories, and three original short films, released over the course of the year.\nIn the first episode, you will meet a young girl, whose name will probably ring a bell, as she tries, by every means imaginable, to get her hands on her grandfather's watch (Victorinox Original Chronograph Limited Edition) ...\n\n\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\n\nLaurent Ulrich   Director\nMichel Frutig   Production manager\nDaniel Steffen   Cinematographer\nJulien Humbert-Droz  Camera operator\n\nHanspeter Wieland  Gaffer\nJ\u00fcrg N\u00e4geli   Sound technician\n\nJehan Radwan   Make-up artist\n\nNorbert Gubser   Alp\u00f6hi\nVal\u00e9rie Schneider  Heidi\n\nPatrizia Kettenbach  Casting agency\n\nAlessandro Biffi   Postproduction (cut\/color correction)\nMichael Vescovi   Sound engineer\/mastering\nAnna Murphy   Title track (composition, vocals, recording and mastering)\n\n\nSpecial thanks to Hans-Ulrich Eggen for his generous support and the beautiful shooting location.\n\nProduced by Maybaum Film",
