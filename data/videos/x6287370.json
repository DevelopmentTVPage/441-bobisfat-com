    "transcripts": "The revolutionary new Scooba three cycle cleaning process. Redesigned from the ground up to clean hard floors three times better than ever before. Scooba starts by sweeping the floor, dry debris is funneled through the robot into the tank at the back. The tank is engineered to keep the dirty water and fresh cleaning solution separate. So dirty water is never put back on the floor. At the same time a brush behind the cleaning head distributes cleaning solution to soak into stuck on messes. So when Scooba makes a second pass. The 600 RPM scrubbing brush loosens the grime. A squeegee then suctions for dirty water off the floor. And deposits it in the tank. Scooba continues passing over the floor. Scrubbing and suctioning until the floors clean. Finally Scooba makes a squeegee finish past to remove water from the floor, leaving only clean behind. The proof is in the tank. I-Robot Scooba 450. Brilliantly clean hard floors every day. The easy way.",
