    "transcripts": "[MUSIC PLAYING] Hi. I'm Teresa with Cuisinart. And here we have Cuisinart's deep fryer. This deep fryer holds up to 1.1 liters of oil, which is in there right now, because we're going to try some coconut shrimp. \n\nI'm going to place the basket inside of the deep fryer. It has an adjustable temperature control, right up front, with an on\/off educator light. When you turn it on, indicator light will be red and when it's ready to fry, when it's at the temperature, it turns green. And here's the adjustable temperature control. \n\nI'm going to give this a few minutes. It also has a filter right in here that you can take out, and you can actually remove from here and rinse it, to get rid of all the odors. It's a nice brushed stainless steel housing. And you can see, the footprint is actually very small. It's also a perfect size for apartment dwellers or kids in college. \n\nSo I think our coconut shrimp are now ready. Again, you can just pour them out of the basket onto this plate. There we have deep fried coconut shrimp made in Cuisinart's deep fryer. \n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]",
