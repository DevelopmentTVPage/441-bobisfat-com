In diffused mode a jet of air is released from the front aperture. The airflow is guided over a 45 degree projector, which sends the airflow wide. Select a mode using the remote and air is drawn in at the base of the machine, where it's powerfully accelerated by the mixed flow impeller up to the air locks. They channel airflow between the front and rear aperture. Here in diffused mode the airlocks let a fifth of the air flow into the front aperture. In focus mode the front aperture is sealed sending all airflow into the rear aperture. As airflow is accelerated around the loop, it is heated by PTC ceramic plate. Then, it's powerfully projected in focus mode or diffused mode the hot and cool functionality.",
