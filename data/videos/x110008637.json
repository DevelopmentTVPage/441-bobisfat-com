    "transcripts": "Cleanwater Infant Tub with Built in Thermometer by 4 Moms\r\n\r\nThis infant tub will make infant bathing easier for babies and parents. Its built-in digital thermometer brings a fresh approach to infant Cleanwater Infant Tub bathing. The unique design creates a gentle circulating flow within the tub, cradling baby in clean, warm water. The fast responding digital thermometer makes it easy to set and maintain a comfortable water temperature. The display is color-coded to indicate when the water is cold, warm, or hot. Additional benefits include sidewall drains which continually expel dirty water and a contoured bottom that enables the tub to be used in single- and double-basin sinks and all bath tubs. Never leave your child unattended in the bath tub. Discontinue use if product becomes damaged or broken. Requires 3 AA batteries (not included).\r\n\r\nCleanwater Infant Tub with Built in Thermometer by 4 Moms\r\n\r\nI\u0092m Jenn of 4 Moms and we developed the Cleanwater Infant Tub after our first child was born.\r\n\r\nThe problem with infant tubs is that they hold a small pool of water.  So after your baby spends a day in diapers, you wind-up bathing them in water that\u0092s dirty and gross.\r\n\r\nOur tub is the only one used with running water.  The clean water flows in while dirty water rinses away.  There\u0092s a clean water reservoir so you never have to rinse your baby in the water they\u0092ve been sitting in.  And getting the perfect temperature is a breeze with the built-in color changing thermometer.\r\n\r\nThe Cleanwater Infant Tub from 4 Moms.  Our water is clean because kids get dirty.",
