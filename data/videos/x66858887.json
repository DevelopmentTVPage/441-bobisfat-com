I don't want that kinda mess on me. \n\nDAN: Look at this. It is almost too bright for my eyes!\n\nGAB: Yeah. Now enjoy the cleanliness for a moment. Have you  enjoyed it?\n\nDAN: Yeah.\n\nGAB: Now we're gonna get it real dirty. See if we can wash it out. We messed it up really good. Alright Dan do you have your goggles on? \n\nDAN: Yup my body is ready.\n\nGAB: Excellent. here we go. I blasted him with ketchup.\n\nDAN: That was really direct actually.\n\nGAB: That is lovely. I hit him with chocolate pudding. Nailed it! I can't believe it knocked your googles off. And I hit him with mint chocolate chip ice cream. Directly in the face! You just turned to a completely different color. Oh man! Man that is gross. Made an absolute dog's dinner for lab coat. Well, not it's up to Tide to get this lab coat clean. \n\nDAN: Yeah they got their workout.\n\nGAB: They do indeed.",
