    "transcripts": "Oh we were definitely a family of cooks. There's one meal was fixed we were discussing what would happen next I would say but I don't have time for a super week fine palate I think I have a popular talent. Such a good pair diver scallops. They have this big lush semi-sweet quality so you get the pan really warm where the oil is shimmering. You need an incredible heavy hand taking the stand the constant heat without getting hot spots when you try peek at them and you likely just relieve. Karma wise once you develop the sugars on the top and they get really crunchy brown than yours said you ought to have something really divine. I must have bought all I had. For my person. In the first restaurant we just started with nothing so I probably took everything for me and I mean there were other parts in hand man and awful things happen like the metal separated a lot of different things you should realize that it was such superior quality. I think everybody's inspired gradients but. I still couldn't believe it doesn't look delicious and it doesn't look like it's going to make people happy and I don't like being on the menu.",
