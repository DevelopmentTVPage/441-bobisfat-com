First make sure that your dirty water tank is full when it is full it will pick up in the water and you will notice a change in pitch like that. You can empty it by removing the tank like so and dumping it out in the sink after you finish emptying it. Remove the tank lid and rinse it out along with your foam filter. Next remove your nozzle and rinse it out if it has any clogs in there. Once you're done place your nozzle back in along with your dirty water tank. Lastly make sure this hose tool connection doors closed once everything is put back together. You should notice a significant change in pick up performance. Hope this helps if you have any more questions or concerns feel free to reach out to us on Facebook, Twitter or email me personally at Ian's at McCormick at t floor care dot com.",
