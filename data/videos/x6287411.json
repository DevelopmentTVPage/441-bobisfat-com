    "transcripts": "Well I think the sort of connotation that you are so elitist or it had to be at a fancy French rational and I just didn't feel that I had to be the case. My name is David Chang the chef found her in the name of the restaurants. We have to show muscles their plump for and how the higher need to shell ratio. Is just nice and hot. Add the garlic cooked and they'll get a burger and a ginger at the chop scallions. Then you're going to add. The Korean and that sort of where the oil. Then you're going to add your clean muscles and sort of make sure that it's covered in the in the sauce and I added black pepper to share the editor and you and your socket. Basically when the muscles are open to fully open they're reading. How they worked at other places where it's not all clad it's just Joe in the end all clouds built to last. That's just a reality. I've only use all clad really my entire career it's only in the best Kitchens. We just wanted to make the best food possible at a price point that everybody could afford you know it was food that we wanted to eat food that we cook for people that we want to serve.",
