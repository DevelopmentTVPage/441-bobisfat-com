    "transcripts": "[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nToday we're going to be cutting up a peach. You want to find this suture here. That's a natural place for you to put your knife. I'm using a four and a half inch parer. I'm going to insert my knife into that suture until I feel that stone in the center and then I'm just going to rotate the knife around. So I'm going to take my knife and I'm simply going to be working around. So just insert the knife, just draw some nice slices. I really love sliced peaches with something like salmon. The second thing I'm going to do with the peach is to dice it. I'm going to peel the peach first. I'm just going to insert my knife right underneath the skin. The nice thing about this knife is that it gives you good control. Now that we have our peeled peach, I'm going to make about quarter inch slices to start it and that's going to give you a quarter inch dice in the end. And then I'm going to turn them on their side and simply go a quarter inch along the other direction. Diced peaches are great for something like a salsa. And there's our dice for our salsa and our slices for snacking.",
