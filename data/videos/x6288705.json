    "transcripts": "Introducing the smart grill with powerful heating elements embedded into the plates. The smart grill preheats faster and cooks quicker with the convenience of being dishwasher safe. One of the new innovations is the sensors built into the plates. These elements IQ sensors will detect when you put something cold, like a steak on the plates. After they detect the temperature drop. The elements compensate by injecting more heat into the plate so it maintains the temperature that you want. The grill opens flat for more surface area so you can barbecue your meats on one side and grill your veggies on the other with all the drips collecting in the middle. The six adjustable hot settings with floating hinge which means you can evenly toast panini's or grill delicate fish without the top plate crushing the contents. The LCD display simplifies cooking too. Set a temperature and a time. And when the group chimes you're ready to cook. It's best to clean the plates while there's still warm. All you need is some wet paper towel. Just wipe it down and then pop them in the dishwasher. The smart grill, truly another great innovation by Breville.",
