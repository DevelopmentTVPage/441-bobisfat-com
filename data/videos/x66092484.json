Insert the attachment into the hub of your KitchenAid stand mixer. Secure and place the fruit and vegetable skewer on to the mount. Turn it counter clock wise and place it into place. \n\nPlace a bowl or plate under the spiralizer attachment and secure the food to the fruit and vegetable skewer placing firmly into the skewer. Next, if you're using the peeler, be sure to install on to the attachment first by sliding it into the bottom of the blade carrier. Until it clicks into place. Insert your desired blade into the holder at the top. Pull the release lever then push the blade carrier towards the stand mixer and align the blade core with the center of your food. Place the blade core into the fruit or vegetable fro added stability. Begin with the stir speed  and then move to the desired speed that works with your fruit or vegetable . Speeds 4 and 6 usually work best. IMPORTANT: When finished, remove the blade before removing your food item.\n\nDisassembling your KitchenAid Spiralizer with peel, core, and slice attachment.
