    "transcripts": "Whether you're washing a handful of fruits and vegetables, or draining a whole pot of pasta, our stainless steel colander is beautifully finished, and quick to drain. \n\nOur colander's broad, soft handles are comfortable and non-slip to provide a firm grip when you shake the colander to drain water. Non-slip feet keep the colander steady in the sink. \n\nThe four-quart capacity is large enough to drain a pot of pasta, or rinse large batches of grapes, berries, or spinach. The attractive, brushed stainless steel colander can double as a fruit bowl in the dining room, as well. \n\nHere's a good tip. You can also use your colander as the splatter shield when frying. Simply top the pan with an upside-down metal colander to protect yourself from burns, while still allowing heat to escape.",
