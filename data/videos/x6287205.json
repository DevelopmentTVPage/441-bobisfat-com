    "transcripts": "High second thought 59. This is Ian from Hoover. I saw your review on Hoover dot com and want to help with their wind tunnel three pro we want to help with your clogging problem. Clocks in the hose usually stem from a dirty filter suction decreases just enough for larger debris to make it through the hose and into the cup. Here's how to get it back to full strength. Shut off and unplug your machine and remove the dirt cup then pop open the lid and pull out this filter. Be sure to check its underside here. If it's dirty rinse it under warm water squeeze it out and let it dry on its edge for 24 hours. If you place a wet filter back into the dirt cup dirt builds up and blocks the airflow. Now check for clogs in your main hose by detaching it here and twisting here. Use a broom handle to knock out any debris. Now those are the two likeliest places for air flow blockage but if your filter was clean and there is no clogging your main hose I have one more place for you to check the lower hose. Lay your vacuum down remove the bottom guard and your brush roll. Now use a grabber tool to pull out any obstructions in your lower hose. Once you put everything back together you should see a significant change in performance. Let us know if you need more help via Facebook, Twitter or email me personally at the end McCormick at floor care dot com.",
