Press the button on the back corner of the cube to turn it on and start Braava a nearby. The cube acts as a beacon emitting a signal that guides Braava cleaning once Braava starts cleaning it tries to establish a connection to the north star navigation cube indicated by one flashing blue light on the navigation system indicator. Once Braava has locked onto the cube Braava's lights turn solid blue. The navigation system indicator also indicates Braava's range, as Braava gets to the edge of its range, such as going out of the room or far from the north star navigation cue the number of lights will go down. Once Braava has completed its run. You can move the cube to clean a different part of your home.",
