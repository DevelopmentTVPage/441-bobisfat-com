    "transcripts": "When you go to someone's house for a holiday dinner or a party, you always take along a little gift, right? Right. But there's one group that almost always gets forgotten in the gifting process. These guys. So today, treats for our furry little friends. Put whole wheat flour and baking powder in one bowl, then peanut butter and milk in another. Mix the peanut butter and milk well. Then add the peanut butter mixture to the dry ingredients and combine. Remove from the bowl, place on a floured surface, and knead well about two minutes. \n\nPat dough out about one quarter inch thick and cut into desired shapes. And of course, I've chosen to use the classic dog bone-shaped cookie cutter. Put it on a baking sheet. And bake about 20 minutes at 375 degrees. Let them cool, then try them out on your four-legged friends. I can assure you they'll love them. And when you put them in something cool and make them pretty like this to take as a gift, everyone will love you.",
