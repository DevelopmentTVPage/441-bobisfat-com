    "transcripts": "Really my training. For my palate was really just growing up and eating really well and I grew up mostly in France and Italy farther than places like Rome and good farce in Paris in general. I kind of stay within my repertoire a lot and I love to make things that just make you happy. Today made of ham roast chicken with a dish and a sauce I season my god my chicken skin side down in the pan get it nice and golden brown flipped it over finished of you and then you take it out of the chicken rest while the chickens resting cooked my shallots to graze with brandy and Veal stock reduced it down and then I had a little bit of heavy claim and then I put a little bit of mustard in there and. Voila the most amazing thing for me is when you cook at all. It's just a lot easier. The heat is dispersed evenly and the other thing is that I love that it's made in America about trouble ahead and never made it anywhere from to get involved cooking. You know not only do you give me a job or to give your life.",
