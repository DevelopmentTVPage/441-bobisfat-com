    "transcripts": "Tofu is something that you should know how to cook. And here are two great ways to make it. Drain water from the package, then sandwich between layers of paper towel. And top with a flat, heavy object. Leave about 30 minutes to press out the excess moisture. Then cut into cubes and stir fry in a little oil until crisp. And add any vegetables you like. It makes a great meal or take the block, slice horizontally, add sesame oil and salt. And cook in a hot grill pan until well-marked on both sides and serve. It's a super healthy protein, really versatile, and cholesterol free. And if you thought you didn't like it, well, think again.",
