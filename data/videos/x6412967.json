We'll start by removing the leg first. \n\n[MUSIC PLAYING] \n\nPull the leg away from the body and slice through the skin. You can use a heavier knife to help the whole leg\/thigh section come off. I like to separate the thigh from the leg by putting my knife right at the socket and cutting down. Leave The legs hole because they look nicer that way. And now, by following the breastbone with your knife, you can make one long cut and remove the breast in one whole piece. And that makes for beautiful and simple carving. And finally, if you follow where the wing meets the body, it's one simple cut to separate and cut it off. Since this is usually a once-a-year thing, take a breath, take your time, and it will be beautiful. \n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]",
