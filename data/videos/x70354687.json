    "transcripts": "What's that blue light? It's the Wine Enthusiast electric blue corkscrew. it charges on its base the blue light glows. The base also holds a foil cutter end the corkscrew itself has a really nice feel to it. 2 button designs that take the cork out the up button removes the cork from the coil . just have to take your foil cutter and leave the foil, put the corkscrew on top of the bottle comma push the down button and again the blue light shines. and the cork is out we don't know an easier way to take the cork out of the bottle. A button text the cork off the coil. works on almost every Court and we even tried it on the synthetics and they were pretty good. Some of the hard synthetics have a little bit of difficulty. for the most part, it's pretty well. it's great for anyone who has any arthritis problems anything like that. But just in general we really don't know an easier way to take a cork out of a bottle.",
