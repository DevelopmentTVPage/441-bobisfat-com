    "transcripts": "I believe that when you want to extract a favor by that you have to use two techniques be the blooming of spices for posting spices I believe as a home cook you should know the difference. I learned to toast spices when I was back in India. My favorite dish that my mom would make contains about 18 different spices all posted separately you never ever want to go spices that I grew up. Clover cinnamon a green cotton the mustard acumen want to toss them and then grind them and use them and I think part of the band he does really I write not just only my fan art but its rows of ready to put my spices to moderate to low I could become very very slowly. It changes the complexity of the spices makes them home mellow. And you don't have a drying them and they're hard to read. If you don't buy says what I like to do is take this device and infuse it in a hot oil to heat up slowly or put the whole spice in and starts crackling and sizzling and shimmering in the oil and you get this wonderful aroma of the spice cooking but I'm doing dry ground spices I always, always, always keep handy a pot of water or wine or a juice just so that my oil never goes above 212 degrees. If the heat goes above turn cold agrees then we're going to burn the spices make the bitter and acrid and lose all the health benefits all the flavor all the wonderfulness and spices when that happens.",
