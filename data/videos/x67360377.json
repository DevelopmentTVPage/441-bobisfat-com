That's gonna create a nice flat surface for you. Then you're going to follow the curvature of the orange taking the peel off. It's important that you're knife is really sharp for this because you're going to be doing some fine delicate work. The next step is to hold the knife in your hand. You want to slice in between these membranes that you'll see around the orange. That's what's gonna five you the segments. So I slice on one side of the orange first and then I simply slice on the other side of the membrane. And that is how you segment an orange",
