The Pitter features a removable splatter shield that directs juices downward and prevents them from soiling your work area. When not in use, the splatter shield fits inside the front chamber and a lock holds the Pitter closed for convenient storage. Sturdy, die-cast zinc construction removes pits with ease, and soft, comfortable non-slip handles absorb pressure while you squeeze. The holder is extra large to accommodate Bing cherries and has a recessed cup to securely hold smaller varieties when pitting. Also try the Pitter to prepare fresh cherries for small children. The Cherry & Olive Pitter should be placed in the dishwasher in its unlocked position.",

    "transcripts": "At OXO during cherry season we go through pounds and pounds of fresh cherries. We love the taste but not the pits. We set out to create a pitter that could handle even the largest of cherries with a little mess as possible. The pitter features a removable splatter shield that directs juices downward and prevents them from making a mess in your work area. Sturdy diecast zinc construction removes pits with ease. And a soft comfortable non slip handle absorbs pressure while you squeeze. The holder is extra large to accommodate big cherries and has a recess cup to secure smaller varieties when pitting. When not in use, the splatter shield fits inside the front chamber and the lock holds the pitter closed for convenient storage. Here's a good tip, during the development of this product, our focus was creating a cherry pitter the fact that it also pits olives was a lucky discovery in the testing process.",
