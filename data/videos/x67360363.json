You want to have a nice flat surface here so it's not going to be moving around. Quarter these; go straight down. WE're going to be slicing this down. As we're doing his always be mindful your fingers are back. These last ones here we'll do a little trick. We're gonna leave this root on, go upside down like that. And we're gonna go all the way down not following through. Once you haev it down, they fan out. Alright here we have strawberries three ways. we have the quarters for salads, the slices for tarts, and then the edible garnish.",
