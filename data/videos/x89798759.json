    "description": "See how to create Soo Joo Park\u2019s bold statement purple eyeshadow look in this makeup tutorial. Get the look with Infallible Paints Eyeshadow, Lip Paint, Blush, and Eyeliner by L\u2019Oreal Paris.\n\nStart the shady lady look in a shady violet Infallible Liquid Eyeshadow Paint. The double sided eyeshadow gives you two shades in one to create this dark to light to dark makeup look. Apply the dark shade to the inner and outer corners of the eyelid, then apply the light shade in the middle of the lid. Highlight the eyes with Infallible Paints Eyeliner in White Party along the lower lashline. Balance the strong eye with soft blush. Add a small pop of color to the cheeks using the Infallible Long Lasting Blush Palette. Soo Joo goes Taupeless by applying that shade of Infallible Lip Paint. Go paint yourself with L\u2019Or\u00e9al Infallible Paints.",
