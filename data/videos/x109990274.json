Nicole's just moved into her room and she is not very happy about this bed. Nicole:Yeah. This mattress is terrible. Jessica:Yeah and other people have slept on it before. Nicole: Eww. Gross. I hadn't even thought about that. Jessica: But I know the solution. I got totally grossed out too, but Bed Bath & Beyond hooked me up with a mattress protector. This protector encases the mattress creating a barrier between you and the bed and it keeps out dust mites and bed bugs. Nicole: Eww. I wouldn't want any of those. Jessica: Now let's talk comfort. On top of the protector we added a foam mattress topper, its soft and gives support and I have one too it is so comfortable. Nicole: Yeah. I can tell.It's awesome. Jessica:Another option is a fiber bed which is a slightly different feel. More squishy. Nicole: Yeah, your right, but I kinda like them all together. Jessica: Nice sheets. Nicole: Thanks. I had to get these sheets called Twin XL. I had never even heard of them before. Jessica: Yeah well a lot of colleges have extra long mattresses. Nicole: Yeah, I mean the nice thing is that I got to buy a new pair of sheets. Feel them they are so comfy. Jessica: They are so nice. You know Bed Bath & Beyond has a ton of Twin XL sheets you can choose from so you can get the style and color you want. Nicole I love your comforter its so quirky, and fun and colorful and these pillows are so cool. Nicole: I know right.Thanks. Jessica: You're welcome. Do you get a body pillow? Nicole: I did and its so comfortable. Jessica: I know it provides a lot of support when you are leaning against the wall. Nicole: Right and I figured why not incorporate my own style into it. I mean this is the centerpiece of my room and all. Jessica: Exactly and plus this is where you're going to study and where your friends are going to hang out. Nicole: Exactly! Jessica: So, that's how you make your bed better.",
