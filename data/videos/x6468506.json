    "transcripts": "Hi I'm Mary Rogers, director of marketing communications for Cuisinart. This is the Cuisinart pure indulgence 2 quart frozen yogurt and ice cream maker. This product is a lot of fun to use, it's really easy to operate. First you need to put your freezer bowl in the freezer. We recommend overnight at zero degrees and you put it right inside. You put your ingredients in here. You add your ice cream dasher and this is what turns the ice cream as it freezes. You put your lid on and you'll notice the lid has a little hole in it where as your ice cream is almost finished you can add in small pieces of fruit or chocolate chips or even a couple of small pieces of nuts and after you get all of your ingredients in, you just turn it on. It's beautifully designed it has a stainless steel housing and guess what in 25 minutes you're gonna have fresh flavorful ice cream or frozen yogurt right at home.",
