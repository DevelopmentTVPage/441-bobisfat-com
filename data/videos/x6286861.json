    "transcripts": "They wanted to make a cauliflower and sort of a chicken and waffles. One day I was reading the new York times actually and there was a potato. Salad that was our work we smoked it deep fried it put it on the wall and it was like mind blowing. We use it for the cauliflower that's a little bit of sweetness. Every chip brings a different flavor and everybody has a different flavors of the combination. You can see them so I'm going to put the foil on to keep the smoke and. At home. It does take about 10 to 15 minutes to get smoke out of the gym. Once the chips are really hot. We put a tray down but our vegetables on top of the tray covered again. The tin foil. And bring in a. Smoke and then we let a smoke. For a minute two minutes turn the heat off and let it sit-in the smoke for a couple more and then when we pull the tin foil off it should be nice. It's full. So now we look at however we would. Cook and. Toss in an oil. Stir fry. Pan fry it. Put it in the oven. Deep fried. That at the bottom there. When we first started putting on the menu there were people really I don't want to try and now most people are like I want more smoke gimme more smoke and here we are addicted to nation that's what there is to us.",
