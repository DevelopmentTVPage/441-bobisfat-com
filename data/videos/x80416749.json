    "transcripts": "Hi I'm Mary Rogers and this is the Cuisinart sandwich grill it's capable of grilling two sandwiches two omelets and even two pieces of french toast it has really high raised edges here and a non-stick baking plate the high edges seal in the sandwich ingredients it's also really thick pocket so you can get big stuff sandwiches it has a nice painted finish on the outside and silver it also has a ready to cook light the light happens to be green so let's go ahead and put in that sandwich. Now you're going to see how easy its going to be to make a grilled sandwich comes out nice and toasted just set it right in there same on the other side close the lid and then i'm going to show you the lock-down feature you just close this press it down that locks the sandwich in place and that's what's going to help grip those raised edges come together and seal the sandwich and toast it really nice and done. In a few minutes we'll come back and check on it, so the light turn green which means our sandwich is ready let's check out our tomato mozzarella and basil sandwich. Oh that looks nice and toasty and gooey obviously I overstuffed it a little bit, but it came out really easy even though there's lots of cheese involved so there you have it the Cuisinart sandwich grill.",
