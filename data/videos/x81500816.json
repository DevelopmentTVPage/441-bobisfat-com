    "transcripts": "Eating whole fruits and vegetables is great but sometimes I want to really concentrated shot of nutrition and of course it still has to taste good that's what's great about juicing. Juicing allows you to get super concentrated levels of vitamins and minerals without eating impractical amounts of food. The angle basket ejects the pulp into a separate bin so you can continuously juice without having to stop and empty the basket this juicer can handle a wide range of fruits and vegetables and the large opening means less prep also most items you can put in whole there are a lot of lesser quality juicers of this style in the market and sometimes the pulp ejection juicer gets a bad rep but this will make a version is much quieter than most and it's nearly as efficient as the centrifugal juicer not to mention it's also a great value so let's make some juice i'm going to use apple, kale and a variety of vegetables so I'm going to start by cutting the apple into quarters and I think that would be the perfect size to fit in that nice large opening. Okay, I'm just going to turn it on. There see how easy that was i'm going to show you just how much juice we got out of those fruits and vegetables, look at that see how dry it is that's because we got all the juice out.",
