    "transcripts": "Dogs and cats are part of our family, but we don't always love the furry mess they make. The OXO Furlifter line solves this pet peef. The OXO Furlifter system consists of a brush at the base. The brush lifts fur, hair, and lint off clothing, furniture, and fabric surfaces -- effectively trapping it in its micro bristles. Clear directional arrows on the brush show you which way to swipe. You can simply lift the brush over to sweep in the other direction. When the brush has gathered, fur lint, and hair, dunk it into the base. Fibers inside the base clear the brush and trap fur inside. The brush emerges clear and ready to continue cleaning. When the base is full, simply remove the cap to empty the collected fur. The fur lifter comes in three sizes. The furniture brush is great for larger surfaces life chairs, sofas, ottomans, and bed spreads. It's pivoting handle keeps you knuckles lifted above the surface. The garment brush is ideal for clothing. and the on the go brush is sized perfectly for keeping in your purse or bag or even in your glove compartment. Furlifters  require no refills meaning less wasted time, money, and garbage in land fills. Furlifter brushes make it easier to keep your house fur free so you can continue enjoying everyday living with your pets.",
