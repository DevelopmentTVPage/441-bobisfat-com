So I was super excited for the new one to come out, but when I saw the iPhone SE I said hey isn't this the old iPhone 5? Sure it's a little better, but I thought the SE would bring something extra to the market. Instead, it seems to have the same engineering as the old one. Apple said SE stands for special edition but I've got some other ideas. They say it's highly recyclable so maybe SE stands for super environmental ? it has a 4K camera and their fastest processor so it could mean shoot and edit. You know what? the thing is full of old iPhone parts so I bet it stands for Surplus Electronics. Well who cares why it's called SE? What I really want to know is: will it blend?\n\nI think I'll push the smash everything button.\n\n[RUMBLING]\n\nI always say don't breathe this, but this time I'll take a little whiff. Woof! smells electrical. Hey! I think i figured out what SE stands for!",
