    "transcripts": "We use this technique for multiple different types of game a game of chicken a large poultry small poultry the way we decided to start this technique was basically because of the peking duck sadducee throughout China town and the process of how they air dry in the basin and they wrote to the really crackling so yes. This right here is just sugar and citrus juice. Brought down to Carmel just like a lack of. We base the skin with the sauce that's for sure so we want to do is try that out as well. So it becomes one with the skin then we break it comes very very nice and very uniform. The duck is facing the fan and it's billowing this again really really dry so the more power the quicker it's going to dry. Created the show. In about '45 minutes and the dryness and the lacquer is right about where we want. It's almost time to go into the oven. It's about 350 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes. Just depends on how I'm done you know we'll let the breast kind of rest and stay really nice and medium around. It's going to get really really crunchy and crackly. Protect a lot of that really beautiful meat on the inside. That gives it a very signature kind of feel to what we do. That makes us unique and it also makes some product really special.",
