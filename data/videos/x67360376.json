The purpose for that is that you want it nice and stable as you take the skin off. We're going to go straight down the middle. We're going to take the insides and clean them out. Okay we have de-seeded our papayas nice and clean. \nSo what we'll so is we're going to slice this about medium size. So next one here, we're going to do a large dice. Once you have it here, go straight. This last piece what we're going to do is we're going to cut it straight down this way. From here start making julienne cuts. The knife is very sharp and you want to utilize the entire blade of the knife. Okay here's our papaya three ways. We have a medium dice for salad, we have slices for a food tray, and julienne for a fritter. ",
