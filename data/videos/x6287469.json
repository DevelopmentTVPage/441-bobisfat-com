Then use the dusting brush to get rid of any dust and debris. Replace the lid and twist it back to the locked position. Lift out the filter here whenever it's dirty then push to remove the cover and pull out the exhaust filter filters under running water. It's OK to squeeze and twist the foam filter. Now let them air dry for at least 24 hours. Both filters. Be sure to push the filter all the way down. Put the bottom of the door on to the cleaner and tilted back until it clicks to clean the brush roll from the bottom with a Phillips lifter and pull off the bottom plate and cut through any hair or threads and see if you've got any questions. We've got you covered. Just reach out on Facebook or Twitter or give us a call.",
