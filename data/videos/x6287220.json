If your suction power has steadily diminished that usually indicates that there could be one or more clogs that have built up in your air path. That's an easy fix. Here's what to do first detach your dirt cup and twist off the lid to access your filter. Pull out your filter and check its underside here. If it looks dirty. Run it under warm water and let it dry on its edge for 24 hours. Even if you regularly rents it. Placing a filter that's not fully dry back into your canister could clog your filter. Next check your lower hose for clogged by removing it here you should be able to visually inspect if there is a blockage. If there is a blockage you can remove it with a grabber tool like so. Next remove your air valve by pressing on these taps with your four fingers and pull it out like so. If there's anything jammed in there you can tap the debris out into a waste basket. If you're still overheats on area rugs try turning this air valve dials who are in the floor to slightly reduce suction and allow air to pass through the vacuum. Let us know if you need more help via Facebook, Twitter or email me directly at. In that McCormick at t floor care dot com.",
