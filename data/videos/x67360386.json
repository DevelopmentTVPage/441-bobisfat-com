Simply slice off the top, get rid of that. using my finger as a guide, make thin slices. These kind of slices are great for something like steamed fish. You can pickle them if you want. For the next jalapeno I'm going to be using my chef knife here. It gives me the leverage I need. You're using kind of a rocking motion during this process. Make sure we clean up the rest of our jalapeno. If there are any ribs or membranes left. The next thing I'm going to do is slice the jalapeno in to nice thin slices and then dice it. Then if you decide you ant to dice them, you can simply take those ribbons and go across them on the opposite direction. Jalapeno cut three ways, rounds, ribbons, and diced.",
