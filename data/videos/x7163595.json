    "transcripts": "My pastry chef Sebastien Rouxel taught me how to make this cobbler and one of the things he taught me about fruit was you want to coat it with flowers so it doesn't leach out a lot of water because the last thing you want to have is a watery cobbler. Making our sauce our butterscotch sauce in the same pot allows us to really be very efficient in what we're doing and so it's a little bit unorthodox when you think about a cobbler because typically you see cobblers baked in baking pans, um in this one we're going to make our sauce make our entire recipe of the cobbler in our sauce pot and being able to bake it in the same in, the same sauce pot. Part of the things that we do that I think is a little different is make the sour cream drop biscuits and you know it's something that my mother made. So those go on top of the of the fruit and it gives it a a cake like texture which is really wonderful because you have this this one the this amazing kind of creamy butterscotch apples at the bottom and then the biscuit and then of course the streusel on top of the butter, and the pecan, and brown sugar. With any warn dessert, um whether it's the cobbler or an apple pie, or warm chocolate brownies there's nothing, nothing better to go with it then a beautiful vanilla ice cream.",
