While they are warming, cut the bacon in half, and form the ground beef into patties. Once the grill is warmed up, place the patties on the grill. Place the bacon on the skillet. Fry the bacon for 2-3 minutes, then flip and fry until fully cooked. Flip the burger patties and get your egg ready. Turn the heat off to the skillet, the residual heat will fry the egg. About one minute before removing the patties, place the cheese on the patty and close the lid. After a minute, remove the burgers and let rest for 5 minutes. Prep your condiments and place the burger on the bun, then place the bacon on the buger with the egg on top. Once you are ready, top your burger with the other half of your bun and enjoy!\n\nwww.CampChef.com\nhttp:\/\/www.campchef.com\/blog\/bacon-egg-and-cheese-burger\nhttp:\/\/www.campchef.com\/big-gas-grill-three-burner-stove.html\nhttp:\/\/www.campchef.com\/deluxe-stainless-bbq-grill-box-90-accessory.html\nhttp:\/\/www.campchef.com\/cast-iron-cookware\/11-square-skillet.html",
