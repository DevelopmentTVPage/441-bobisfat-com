    "transcripts": "Hi I'm Carla and I'm gonna show you how you can juice or puree  a fresh wheat grass in your Novis Vita Juicer. The first thing we need to do is build the juicer, first take your just drop spout and place it right here this is where the juice is gonna come out of. Next take the inner container and place inside of the juicer. This lines the interior so it doesn't get wet or sticky\/ Put the centrifuge right inside of the inner container, the lid locks right into place, and the last past is the pusher. This forces the fruit or vegetables down the feed tube. So like I said the Novis Vita Juicer can easily juice or puree a fresh wheat grass, if you'd rather have a puree all you need to do is remove the lid and lock the puree attachment right into place, put it back on and you're ready to go. So here I have some fresh wheat grass that's been soaking in a bowl of water for just a few minutes because wheat grass does not have a lot of natural juice you are more than welcome to alternate the fresh wheat grass with a couple tablespoons of water down the feed tube. So let's get started, remove the pusher and with little handfuls start juicing the wheat grass. And when you're done juicing just turn the machine off, lock up the drop spot and drink away. ",
