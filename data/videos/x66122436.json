The steel frame dish rack has a movable swivel spout that drains out water into the sink not on your counter top and you can move the spout to reposition the dish rack whatever suits your space. Quick drying means less chance of water marks or mildew so the plastic parts have a coating that forces water to spread on their surface so it dries more quickly preventing residue build up. The utensil holder has a bamboo knife block-- safe and secure. This wine glass holder hold up to four wine glasses even those extra large bordeaux wine glasses and it's removable. The dish rack is easy to clean and completely corrosion resistant and the steel frame is finger print proof. This is the large version and here are the smaller versions in grey and white. Wash the dishes more efficiently.",
