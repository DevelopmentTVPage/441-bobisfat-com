And if you've heard about deep fried turkey, you've heard about how great it is, and it is. \n\n[MUSIC PLAYING] \n\nSo today we're deep frying a turkey. But we're not deep frying outside, we're deep frying inside. And we're not dunking it, we're using a rotisserie. Confused? You won't be for long. \n\nCombined salt, sage, paprika, garlic powder, and black pepper. Mix, and rub well into the turkey. Fit onto the rotisserie turning brackets, and tie the turkey with kitchen string to secure. \n\nFill the reservoir with oil, heat to 375, and when ready slowly lower the turkey and start the rotisserie. Now here's the beautiful part. Instead of taking roughly 13 minutes a pound in the oven to cook, it's more like three to three and a half minutes a pound in the fryer. \n\nAnd a turkey cooked the right way, at the right temperature, is not greasy at all. It's just delicious. When it's done, remove, let drain and voila. Look at it. It's just tremendous. I call it \"turfection\". That's turkey perfection. It's amazing. \n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]",
