The name 5K refers to the lamp\u2019s maximum light output of 5,000 Watts, an amount that years of research has determined is a mid-range, very workable intensity to achieve satisfying results from your light therapy. But let\u2019s start with a quick overview of the benefits many people can expect from using an energy lamp. Light therapy is a drug- and chemical-free, natural way to improve your mood and energy. It can be particularly effective for people who feel negative effects from the changing seasons, get the winter blues, experience changes in appetite or who have prolonged periods of reduced exposure to the sun. It can fight fatigue, increase alertness and help you regain focus and concentration. Finally, it can be a stabilizer for those who do shift work or have jet lag. As I mentioned, at its maximum output, the 5K provides a nice level of light intensity to give you a good amount of light therapy in a reasonable period of time. An Optix lens diffuses the light to reduce eyestrain and fatigue, so you\u2019ll be comfortable even during longer therapy sessions. A really important feature of this lamp is its size. 5,000 LUX is a lot of light intensity for an energy lamp the size of the 5K, and you\u2019ll get the advantage of a highly portable lamp that\u2019s easy to pack in your suitcase, briefcase or backpack, so you can easily expand your opportunities for light therapy \u2013 at home or at the dorm or even at the office \u2013 always conveniently and discreetly. So, if you\u2019re looking for an affordable, compact energy lamp that'll go where you do, take a closer look at the Verilux HappyLight Liberty 5K. Thanks for watching, and have a bright day!
