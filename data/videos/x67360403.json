The first way I'm gonna use my 8 inch chef knife here and I'm gonna rotate until I come back to the center. Simply grab the avocado, twist it in half, and then using the knife, pierce it and twist. The first method I'm going to do is slices. Simply grab the peel and peel backwards. Gently pressing down on the avocado, I'm going to put the point of my knife down and make slices going backwards. You can use that in tacos or salads. The second method I'm going to show you in which we'll be using my six inch utility knife here. I'm simply going to cut the avocado in the skin; maybe for guacamole or something like that. Make sure you don't pierce the skin you don't want to cut your hand. Take a larger spoon, dig down until you reach the skin and there's your avocado two ways. Diced and sliced",
