    "transcripts": "Now that you have your braava jet mopping robot home, you're just a few steps away from sending it out on it's first cleaning job. We know you want to get started but make sure you fully charge the battery until the indicator light turns green which could be up to two hours. When the battery is fully charged it's time to select a cleaning pad. Choose a Braava jet cleaning pad that matches how you want to clean your floor. Wet mopping, damp sweeping, or dry sweeping and slide it into the track at the bottom of the robot. If you choose a mopping of damp sweeping pad, fill the tank to the top with warm water. Be sure to replace the cap. The Braava jet robot is designed to clean up 150 square feet in wet mode. Always place your robot in the lower left corner of the area you want to clean. A foot away from any walls. Now your Braava jet is ready to go. Press clean once to wake up the robot, then press clean again to start the job. Braava jet recognizes which type of pad you chose and automatically cleans the way you prefer. Avoid riding up on rugs and other obstacles and even staying away from stairs and other drop offs. When Braava jet is done, it returns to where it started and powers off. Then you can eject the cleaning pad without getting your hnads dirty. To store Braava jet, make sure to empty the tank. Braava jet is small so it can easily be stored wheels down. or on it's side with the battery side down. ",
