    "transcripts": "Hi, this is the Griddler Deluxe. It lays flat. The plates are reversible, removable, and dishwasher safe. The other side's a griddle. \n\nSo it closes, and the nice thing is it has a floating hinge. It's not going to squish your food. It will lay flat on your food, no matter how thick your food is. \n\nIt has dual controls. So the top and the bottom have two different temperature controls. And it has a sear function as well, that it will heat up to 500 degrees for two minutes. So nice.",
