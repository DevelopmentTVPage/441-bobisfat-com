We're gonna cut this in half and as your using this you want to anchor down you, your fingers back,  get some leverage and push down. Save that top. We're going to cut rounds on this bottom half. This rounds are perfect for roasting. With the top half of the corn, what we're going to do is go straight down the middle, perfect for grilling. Another corn here. I'm gonna cut in half so it's a manageable size. We're going to come down and as you're coming down, sometimes this may get a little messy. Once you're here, drop it down to make it a little easier for ya. Alright we have corn three ways, rounds for roasting, halves for grilling, and the kernels for salsa.  ",
