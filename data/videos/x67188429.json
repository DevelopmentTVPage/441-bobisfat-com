It's so easy to use and we can practically put any of our favorite drinks in it to make a slushy or a shake. You'll see that this insert can actually just go right into your freezer. I keep these in the freezer. You could just freeze it overnight or for 4 - 6 hours if you're really on a crunch and pop it right into the glass here",
