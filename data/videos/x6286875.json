    "transcripts": "Right can help keep it flat. I'm not cutting too far down just for this game. Chris says it was something for. The mean time I got my. Hand on higher. Gear for at least a full minute before adding the oil and heat metal it expands and fills in all of the little groove the micro grooves and so it's a smoother surface therefore a stick once for Paris the oil. Wait until oil is just broken. Don't want to wait till it's smoking a lot because when you're burning the oil you want to see a little bit a wisp of smoke. Going to lay this down skin side down. Lay it away from me. That way if I splash any oil it's not a slush fund. Just watch that one as soon as it goes into the pan you're going to press down with us to get contacts. You gotta hold it there until it relaxes and that can take anywhere from. 30 seconds and then at. That point you're going to turn down the heat medium high. Let it cook until it's racing around and crash. And this is a very big piece of fish. So once I put that's going to be done. It's a pink salmon which is one of the lesser species but is very plentiful or sustainable. I think we should be eating what the oceans have to offer us rather than be telling the oceans what we want to eat.",
