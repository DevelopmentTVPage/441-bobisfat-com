    "transcripts": "My name is Bruce Albert we are on the back deck at East Cobb County. This is my Char-Broil grill; it is my tool for outdoor cooking. This is really special to me because it is really a quality piece of equipment. I like the stainless steel, I like these heavy cast-iron grill parts. Really good for self cleaning. I am not a Gourmet Grill Chef. I just put stuff out here and cook it and eat. They come out with more consistent results with this grill is than I did with the Open Fire Grill. Let\u2019s get this thing set up and I've got some sea scallops here. Gotta saute or whatever you call it. Grilling with butter. It\u2019s very even heat easy to control. That's really good scallops are great. Makes some nice grill marks on it. I think it came out really juicy meat does not dry out on this Grill and that is a good juicy steak to me that looks great.",
