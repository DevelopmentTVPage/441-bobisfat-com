Hold the head of cabbage on either side of the knife, press the knife into the edge, draw it back, and then just use the back powerful end of the that knife to go right through the base. So the first cut will be a thin shift and knob for say cole slaw. So you're gonna start here. Hold the head of cabbage, tuck your fingers in, your knuckles forward, put your knife tip on the board, and then just gently rock back. As you get past the leafier part, come in from the top. Next you can cut the other head similar to the first but not cutting all the way to the base. We're just gonna make long streaks. So once you have your long cuts here, again, just going across making nice square patterns. Napa cabbage two ways. Cut thin for cole slaw and cut thick for kimchi and brazing",
