Now, it can be tricky to get this paper off so what you want to do is use your knife and then press down on it firmly and then you can slice the end off and the paper should release. First we're going to slice some garlic. We can use this on a casa sauce maybe fry some up with a little bit of garnish. To chop I'm going to use the eight inch chef knife here. We're simply going to hold the end of the knife between our thumb and our forefinger to give us more control and simply go across the garlic in a locking motion. I also find that garlic paste is rally delicious in vinaigrettes . We're gonna take our chopped garlic and we're going to sprinkle some coarse salt and then take the side of  the blade and just smear it.",
