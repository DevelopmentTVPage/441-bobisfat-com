    "transcripts": "Hey I'm Carl a set up a sporting chef and I want you to meet my new best friend. It's camp pellet grill and smoker. You just load it up. Set the dial and walk away. Now I've used a lot of other pellet smokers. Let me tell you why this one is better. Good digital control unit lets you go from low smoke. High smoke from 175 degrees to over 450 degrees. You can toggle between the internal temperature of the meat with the meat probe and the temperature of the pellet grill and smoker. So from turkey to pork to beef any kind of meat you can think of. But vegetables you can smoke it you can grill it with your camp pellet grill and smoker. Now here's something you're not going to see in other pellet grills. There's a handy cleanup feature here so you don't have to open it up and get the vacuum to suck all the ashes out pull the knob out and the ashes drop into a clean out. Cam it's so incredibly simple it makes so much sense and it's so very camp chef. Now with all these great features you know why this is my new best friend. And believe it or not it costs you less than most of the other name brand pellet grills out there. Camp chef the way to cook outdoors.",
