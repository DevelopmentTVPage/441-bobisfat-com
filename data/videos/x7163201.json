    "transcripts": "When you're making a delicious meal, you want a beautiful grinder that compliments your dinner table and your taste buds. Our flare salt and pepper grinders look great on the table but get the job done in the kitchen as well. Our five grind settings lock in place so you'll never get a coarse grind when you set it to fine. The markings on the front indicate the varying grind settings. A ceramic grinding mechanism crushes peppercorns easily and will never rust or corrode from salt. The non slip grip allows you to grind easily even when your hands are wet or oily. The grinder is positioned at the top of the barrel so when your're done grinding it won't leave any messes on the counter top or table. The clear barrel shows you when it's time to refill and the large opening at the base allows you to quickly pour in salt or pepper corns without a funnel or a mess. Here's a good tip. These grinders offer the clarity of glass but are made from bpa free plastic which makes them lighter and more durable.",
