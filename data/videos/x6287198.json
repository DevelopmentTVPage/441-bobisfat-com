    "transcripts": "Hi Donna this is Ian from Hoover. I read your post on Facebook about those drain holes on the back of your door power those drain holes are actually designed to drain excess water from the clean water tanks reservoir. An easy way to remedy the drainage is to just wipe the reservoir dry with a paper towel and squeeze your trigger for a few seconds to drain this grommet before placing a failed clean water tank back in. If some of that water does drain onto the carpet no worries your dual power will pick it right up on the backstroke. Hope this helps if you have any more questions or concerns feel free to reach out to us on Facebook, Twitter or email me personally at Ian McCormack at floor care dot com.",
