With a blade that spins over 300 miles per hour, it doesn't need to be sharp to get the job done. Instead of chipping away at ice and frozen fruit with sharp edges, the large, blunt design pulverizes virtually anything. And it\u2019s completely safe to clean, too.",

The best blenders, like Blendtec, use a blade that's big and blunt; Smashing and pulverizing rather than slicing for a blend that's faster smoother and safer to clean.
