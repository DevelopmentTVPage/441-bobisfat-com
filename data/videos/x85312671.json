A pretty easy switch for people who decide the compactor was good in it\u2019s time, but it\u2019s time to live a little nicer.\n\nThis unit is 33.9 inches tall to fit right under your countertop. It has a front venting compressor so it doesn\u2019t need to have ventilation. But it can also be free-standing; you can set it up in the game room if you want.\n\nIt has a 96 can holding capacity, or you can adjust the shelves for bottles to cool your craft brews to perfection. It has thick insulation, a double pane glass door that\u2019s reversible, so you can set it up to open either way. And there\u2019s a security lock if you have little kids, or want to keep unwanted customers out.\n\nWatch the video to learn more about the ABR-1770 Beverage Cooler from Newair.",
