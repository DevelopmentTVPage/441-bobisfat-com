We're going to take the bottom off here and take the top off. We're going to go right under the skin. I'm going to be using the chef knife now. We'll cut down against the pit. This side here we're going to cut planks. Go straight down. Once we have it here, taking it down with our julienne cut. As you're cutting remember to tuck your fingers back. Next, what we'll do with these, we'll do a medium dice and you can add this to yogurt. Okay with this mango we're going to do the same thing as before. We're going to do a cross hatch cut. WE're gonna come down moving the fruit not our blade. Do not want the knife to poke through and cut your hand on the other side. This is great if you throw in a little salt a little cayenne on here; it's a perfect snack. Here we have our mango three ways, the julienne cut, the medium dice, and a cross hatch cut.",
