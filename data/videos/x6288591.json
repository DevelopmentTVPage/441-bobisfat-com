    "transcripts": "Hi I'm Mary Rogers director of marketing communications for cuisinarts this is a cuisinart stand mixer. You can get several different attachment separately. This one happens to be our proprietary food processor attachment. It mounts here on the high speed power outlet just by going like this. You line it up and you twist it to lock it into place. This can actually be used as a chopper or a grinder you can use it to do anything like chopping herbs make of it a gret make a small batch of salsa. You open the lid like this and you can prove that the proprietary chopping blade you put in the stem. Like that and now you can mount the reversible slicing or shredding desk on this side it's slicing on that side is treading you just pop it in like that. Put the lid back on. Twist it. Remove the feed tube and now you can slice and thread by putting your right to feed tube all of the removable parts are dishwasher safe. It's a great way to be able to slice and shred with your cuisinarts stand mixer.",
