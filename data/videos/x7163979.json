    "transcripts": "You got the big easy assembled and your first instinct is to go ahead and use it. What I want you to do instead is to go ahead and burn it for about 10 - 15 minutes to just burn off any manufacturing residue that may be there. Then you want to season your cooking chamber. This is all stainless steel. I use a natural 100 percent vegetable oil. Coat it all down really well, stick it in your big easy just like that, turn on your gas back here, turn on your gas here, and then oh I heard it start. You want that to go for about 10 - 15 minutes until you've seasoned that cooking chamber. It'll discolor a bit, but that's not a big deal.",
