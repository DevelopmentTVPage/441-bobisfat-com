Use the bubble level to ensure the template is straight before marking holes. Marking holes with a pencil is a great way to make sure you\u0092re drilling exactly where you need to be. Next drill onto your penciled marks and insert the anchor pins into the wall by pinching the anchor wings back.   After your anchor pins are in place take your mounting bracket and line the holes up on the bracket with the anchor pins. Make sure the arrow on the mounting bracket is facing up. Once you have everything lined up. Screw the mounting bracket into the anchor pins.  Take your shelving unit and identify the top and bottom of the shelf. The bottom which has the small drill holes should be facing down. Slide the shelf onto the mounting bracket.  Lastly screw the shelf from the bottom to finish the installation.  Use the stickers found inside the box to cover screw for a more finished looked. \r\n\r\nNot only are the decorative Shelves, cubes, and rectangle easy to install they also come in varied styles to fit all taste.
