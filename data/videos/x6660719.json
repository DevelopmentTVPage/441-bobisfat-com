Start with a mild cleanser. It will clear away dirt and oil from your skin. You can wash by hand or for even better results, use a brush for at least 60 seconds. Next use an anti-aging moisturizer. It'll help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Apply it evenly and massage gently, using small, circular motions. \n\nIn the morning, make sure you wear SPF 15 or higher to help protect your skin from sun damage. Now finish off with an anti-aging primer, which is great for crow's feet, because it helps soften the look of imperfections. Dab gently under the eyes, on your eyelid, and around crow's feet until it's thoroughly absorbed. That's it. Follow these simple steps every morning. And the look of crow's feet will disappear right before your very eyes. Olay. Your best beautiful.",
