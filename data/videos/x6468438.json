    "transcripts": "Happy July 4th and if it's not July 4th yet, you just wait, 'cause it will be soon. When it comes to food I think you should make something patriotic. Something red, white, and blue. You can always make a potato salad with red, white, and blue potatoes and a vinaigrette instead of mayo. And I say vinaigrette instead of mayo because there is a good chance you're going to be outside and it will be away from refrigeration, and I'm just thinking of you. \n\nOkay - You could also make a patriotic, slushy cocktail with grenadine, vodka and blue curacao. What's not to like? But I like different - so let's make a dessert with something you probably already have in the house - frozen waffles. And since you'll likely already be outside, just grill the frozen waffle until crispy and then add whipped cream, raspberries, blue berries, and powdered sugar. Red, white, and blue - imagine if the founding father's had this when they were writing the deceleration of independence. They might have stayed in the table a long time.",
