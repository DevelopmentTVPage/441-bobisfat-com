    "transcripts": "The Blind Collection by Real Simple was designed exclusively for Bed Bath and Beyond. Our blinds make it simple to fit nearly every window in your home, since they come in one inch or less increments. That means we have a size that can fit your unique windows without the hassle of custom ordering. \n\nThe first thing you will need to do is to pick your window coverings. Think about where they are going and what you want them to do. In a bathroom or a kitchen consider faux wood blinds, which stand up better to moisture and are easy to clean. If you have a large picture windows or sliding doors, vertical blinds can provide a modern look that lets you choose how much light you want in the room at different times of the day. \n\nIn a bedroom or nursery blackout cellular shades can be important. They feature great benefits, like blocking sunlight, noise reduction, and can even help save on energy costs. In any room, cordless window coverings are a safer choice if you are concerned about children or pets. \n\nThe Real Simple Blinds will add a personalized style to your room. These blinds are part of the Real Simple Window Collection and are available exclusively online and at select Bed Bath and Beyond stores.",
