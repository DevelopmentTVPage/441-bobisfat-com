First, you're going to de-stem. Then I'm going to use a three and a half inch parer to take all of the stones out of the cherries. So pick up the cherry and much like any stone fruit, you're going to find that little seam there and then rotate it around to the beginning. And then with the remaining pit cherries, we're going to take the knife, insert the tip just to the side of the stone. Now that we've taken all of the stones out of the cherries, we're going to slice them up. You can simply quarter these. You can use this in a sauce, on a beverage The other method of cutting the cherries is to slice them. With this method, I'm simply going to hold on to the cherry and drag the knife back towards me. This will allow you to use the finished product on something small and delicate like a crostini. Delicious summer cherries, sliced and quartered. ",
