Give your little water babies the next best thing with the splash and scoop bay from step 2. it's packed with aquatic action to keep kids busy and cool on those long summer days. This activity center is like several toys in one. The kids can play with just sand just water or both at once. The water side has a drain plug for easy clean up. The splash and scoop bay comes with a plastic mounting cover that creates a fun waterfall along with a water tower which can be used on both the table and the cover. The kids love dumping water into the tower and watching the water rush down the slide and into the pool below. They also love the water slide with spinner. The bay comes complete with a 7 piece sand and water accessories set including the cool shark scoop. It's all day aquatic fun right out of the box.",
