    "transcripts": "Every OttLite lamp comes with an energy efficient OttLite bulb. Rated to last up to 10,000 hours. Using a 20w OttLite bulb vs a 75w incandescent bulb can give you over 70 dollars in energy savings. Standard yellow lighting can be hot and uncomfortable to work under over 160 degrees. OttLite's natural lighting operates much cooler; nearly half that temperature resulting in a cool comfortable environment. Switching to OttLite lighting is great for the environment too. Using far less energy means reducing carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere. OttLite lighting is great for your eyes, great for the environment, and great for saving money on your electric bill. Just imagine all the things you can see and enjoy when you illuminate your life with OttLite.",
