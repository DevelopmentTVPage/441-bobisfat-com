    "transcripts": "Happy July 4th. And if it's not July 4th yet, you just wait, cause it will be soon. When it comes to food I think you should make something patriotic. Something red, white and blue. You could always make a potato salad with red, white and blue potatoes and a vinaigrette instead of mayo. Ans i say vinaigrette instead of mayo because there's a good chance you'll be outside and it will be away from refrigeration, and I'm just thinking of you. Okay - you could also make a patriotic, slushy cocktail with grenadine, vodka and blue curacao. What's not to like? But i like different - so let's make a dessert with something you probably already have in the house - frozen waffles. And since you'll likely already be outside, just grill the frozen waffle until crispy, and then add whipped cream, raspberries, blueberries and powdered sugar. Red, white & blue - imagine if the Founding Fathers had this when they were writing the Declaration of Independence. They might have stayed at the table a long time.",
