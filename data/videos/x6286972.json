    "transcripts": "The problem with taps and sings is that you wash your hands and then they're dripping and he walked across the floor dripping the water and then you dry them in the hand dryer. But with a new Dyson tap. You wash your hands in the sink under the tap and then you draw your hands. Using the blade over the sink so that all the water remains in the sink. So this is how it works underneath the sink. We have the new Dyson motor high speed high pressure motor. But the air comes in at the bottom and goes through a Hepa filter. And the air goes up through the tap. That's the water going up to the tap and the air goes outside it and then it goes along and the tap. Is under here so the water delivery is here and the sensing is through infrared sensors here to tell when you're putting your hands under to wash or whether you're putting your hands to draw air through the blades.",
