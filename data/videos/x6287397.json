But the one sacrifice that I did make was I took all the money from consulting a book of her with her because I'm of great tools for the right job guys and I thought he was 35 all clad sauteed hands we have to this day you know we start with lamb shoulder or lamb leg or a combination of both and we try to clean up any big pieces of silver skin that on earth has that really remains tough to the cooking process and we keep it about you know into a 3\/4 inch pieces and toss it with herbs that provides a little squeeze of sriracha and I like to add a little bit of sugar treats around is some crazy stuff the flavor we ran off the meat. Need a panel hold up and we rested in a colander home so that we can capture all the the juice we lays the pan with red wine and reduce that and then everything goes into the pot to build the stoop and you let it cook. There are a lot of chefs you know probably starting with Alice waters that really care about the environment care about where the product comes from and how it's raised and it's an amazing trend and I'm grateful that I've been a part of it. So I think to young cook I say you know get your ideals down and get your head the right place and I think he'll go far.",
