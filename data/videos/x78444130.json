    "transcripts": "From Zucchini pasta to beet salad, to apple chips, creating uniform spirals with this spiralizer is as easy as 123. The OCO 3 blade handheld spiralizer makes creating three different of noodles a snap. The spiralizer features three stainless steel color coded blades with an open blade design. Green for 1\/8 spaghetti curls, orange for 1\/4 fettuccine spirals, and red for long ribbons. It also has a non slip grip for comfort and a food holer to protect hands when not in use that doubles as cover for safe storage. To begin, twist to remove all blades and food holder from the spiralizer, select the blade you wish to use,  and twist to secure into the no slip body. The spiralizer will not work correctly with more than one blade attached. Cut the ends of the fruit or vegetable so they're flat and even and place the flat end against the end. Apply pressure  while twisting the vegetable clock wise to get long uniform spirals. Spiralizing works beat when the produce is straight and at least one and a half inches in diameter. If the produce is longer that six inches, Just cut it in half. If it isn't naturally straight, cut it into straight sections. When you start to reach near the end of the food or vegetable, use the food holder for safety to keep your fingers away from the sharp blade.  After a few twists later, you have delicious and healthy noodles or ribbons that you can dress up however you like. The spiralizer comes apart for cleaning, it's dishwasher safe and locks together for storage. Here's a good tip. After using the ribbon blade, use an OXO pairing knife to cut through the stack. It makes for great chips.",
