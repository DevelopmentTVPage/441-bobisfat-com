It's the Diane the animal it's a combination of the two like that's eucalyptus from one of the cow pastures and it's on a blend of Blanche who's my little, my little llama. This is the Japanese indigo that you grew, yeah it's not blue because the leaves were dried and then boiled but this is more indicative of what you think indigo is and this is indigo on Blanche, on blanche again the wild aster is a plant from the ranch and it produces a really beautiful yellow eucalyptus die on noodle and noodle is the, this noodle too, noodle is a sheep I know and noodle is so sweet and the plant we just harvested was euphorbia and on the animal it says winter garden blend on june and so June was at the California variegated mutant lamb that's the breed name mixed with alpaca and mohare.
