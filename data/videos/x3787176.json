The pointed tip and sharp edges make it easier to begin and continue the juicing process. The Reamer is made of solid beech wood, which does not react with acidic fruits, making the product more durable. We do not recommend washing your wooden tools in the dishwasher.",

The OXO Wooden Reamer efficiently juices lemons, limes and other citrus fruits. The pointed tip and extra sharp edges effectively extract the most possible juice from your citrus. The Reamer is made of solid beech wood and a round comfortable and does not react with acidic fruits, making the product durable. When you're done, wash it by hand and let it air dry thoroughly. Here's a good tip. When making lemonade, squeeze lemon juice into water, then dip the reamer in the lemon juice water mixture to get that last bit of juicy pulp.",
