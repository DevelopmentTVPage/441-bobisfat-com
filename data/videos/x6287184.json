I have a few tips to get working again. OK let's make sure tanks are installed correctly. Tilt this tank in like this and pull up on the handle until locks into place. Now tilt the handle back and make sure your other tank is locked in a place like this. While you have it open remove this lid and check this filter for debris. If there's anything in there just rinse it out with warm water. You'll notice the square shaped pan on the front of the tank right here. Slide it up as high as you can like this. Then give it a good tap to make sure it's locked into place. Put the lid back on and lift the handle back up your seat back should be good to go. I hope this helps.",
