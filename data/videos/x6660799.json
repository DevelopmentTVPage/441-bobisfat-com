Because nothing's better than lamb, and when it's this good-- \n\n[MUSIC PLAYING] \n\nPut salt and five peeled cloves of garlic in a mortar and pestle. You could use a processor, but for a small amount I think a mortar and pestle is perfect. \"Pessle\", \"pestle\". Which is it? \"Pessle\" or \"pestle\"? I gotta check, and it is \"pessle\". No \"T\". Well, the \"T\" is there, you don't say it. \n\nThen add two tablespoons each of fresh rosemary and parsley, and mash until well blended. Then stir in Dijon mustard, lemon juice, and olive oil. Mix well. Place a boneless tied leg of lamb on a roasting rack, rub well with the rosemary\/garlic mixture, and put into a 400 degree oven. Roast approximately an hour and a half or until an instant read thermometer shows about 140 degrees for medium rare. \n\nAnd while it cooks we'll make a little sauce for it. Combined plain nonfat yogurt, minced garlic, finely chopped mint, kosher salt, and juice of half a lime, and mix well. And when the lamb is ready, just remove, cover with foil, and let rest 20 minutes before slicing and plating. Lamb for Easter. I'm not saying you have to make it, but you have to make it. \n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]",
