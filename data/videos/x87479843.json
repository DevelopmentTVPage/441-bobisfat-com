    "transcripts": "Hi, I'm Julianne and I'd like to tell you about our Mele & Co. Layla Jewelry Box style 865-11. Founded in 1912 by my great grandfather Emidio Mele, Mele & Co. is proud to have become as America's Jewelry Box. My great grandfather would be proud of how we've grown. Our Layla is a towering example of fashion and function offering organizational style and a modern deep java finish. Her streamlined hour glass shape and squared of footed base gives her classy and contemporary vibe. Her lid opens to reveal a full interior mirror and four open sections which is the perfect place to store daily use jewelry you like easy access to. The delicate dazzled key locks the top section to give those daily items a little more protection from theft. You'll notice our Mele & Co. logo plate which appears in all our boxes and lets you know that this is an authentic Mele & Co. Jewelry box as well as our history tag that has a short message from my dad Ray Mele, our company president. Layla also features six drawers. Five with plenty of open storage for earrings and larger items like watches and chunky bracelets while the bottom drawer features a full set of ring rolls to help you keep all of your rings organized. The sleek curbed necklace doors on both sides have four hooks each plus convenient protective panels to catch longer chains and keep them in place. The interior is fully lined with soft ivory suede fiber to protect your jeweled treasures and help keep them from sliding around. With brushed aluminum finished drawer pulls and classic detailing, our Layla jewelry box style 865-11 is a vibrant and versatile storage solution. And of course, every Mele & Co. jewelry box comes in our classic custom packaging. Mele & Co, America's jewelry box since 1912.",
