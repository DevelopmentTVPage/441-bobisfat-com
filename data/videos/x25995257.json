    "transcripts": "Let's make Mom a special breakfast of a beautiful, fresh fruit, Dutch baby pancake. Start by preheating a heavy ovenproof pan in the oven for at least 10 minutes to get it very hot. In a large bowl put eggs, milk, flour, cinnamon, vanilla, and a splash of bourbon. Beat for about three minutes. Remove the pan from the oven. And add butter to coat the bottom and sides well. Then pour the batter into the hot skillet all at once and immediately put back in the oven. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until puffed and golden brown. While it cooks, whisk together ricotta cheese, honey, and milk until well combined. Remove the pancake from the oven. And top with ricotta, fresh berries, lemon juice, and powdered sugar. And if she doesn't love you for it, well I certainly will.",
