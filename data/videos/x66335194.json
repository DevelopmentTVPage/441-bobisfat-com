One loves neutrals while the other one loves color. So let the design mashup begin.\n\nTo start use a neutral centerpiece like a chandelier. Use patterns that have the same tone; like the rug to keep it neutral but interesting. Make a bold statement once. like these chairs and let them be the star. Bring the outside in for a soothing feeling that still feels colorful.\n\nLayer textures to create a rich look, but use one main color. Here we use green. Stick to a theme like nature and repeat it around the room to keep your eye moving. This dining room came together beautifully with both of their styles creating an even more layered look. \n\nYou can find all the products from both styles online at Bed Bath and Beyond.com",
