    "transcripts": "Hi I'm Cara. And this is the new Hamilton beach big mouth dual plus food processor. Whether you're cooking just for yourself or preparing a large family meal this is the ultimate kitchen appliance. That's because it's a powerful 500 watt motor makes chopping, slicing, shredding, mixing, and pureeing vegetables, cheese, sauce dressing, and doughs easy and quick. The two speeds plus pulse touch pad controls provide flexibility and are easy to use. What makes this processor unique is that includes two processing bowls the 12 couple is perfect for larger quantities and the four cup chopping and mixing bowl is for tasks like chopping garlic and making pesto. The small bowl can be used independently from the large bowl as there is no need to nest one inside the other. Like other processors in the market the large big mouth feed tube can fit most foods so this reduces the need to pre-cut food it comes with the chopping blade and a reversible slicing shredding and grading desk. The bowl lid and blades are all dishwasher safe and they all store together for convenience. Now that's good thinking.",
