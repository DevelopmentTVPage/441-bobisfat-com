First thing I'm going to do is remove the tentacles and you want to make a cut above the eyes. Second thing we're going to do is take the back of the knife and run it down the body of the squid pressing firmly with your thumb near the tail removing everything from inside. So the next thing I'm going to do is with my hands remove the fins and pull the skin off the body. Now that we have our clean bodies, what we're going to do is take one and cut rings with. So this we're going to split the body open and cut into thin strips. This is a great application for flash frying. Here we have squid prepped three ways. Tentacles for brazing, rings cut for frying, and a bod cut thin is great flash fried and wok.",
