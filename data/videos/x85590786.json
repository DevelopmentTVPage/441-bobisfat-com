With a traditional grill you lose much of the energy source and your grill is actually heating the air this is not only inefficient it dries out your food true infrared heat is sent directly to your food less air is circulated and your food retains more moisture during cooking. The true infrared cooking system seers food quickly locking in juices for tender juicier food with a charbroiled flavor cooking with tru-infrared ensures your meals are fifty percent juicier than cooking with a traditional grill tru-infrared also means no flare-ups and that means no charge food our patented great design restricts the airflow that can ignite food drippings and cause flare-ups with the true infrared cooking system juices that drip are instantly vaporized infusing a rich smoky flavor back into your food with less time managing the grill you can make grilling an everyday activity not just a weekend luxury the true infrared technology allows you to enjoy the sizzle of grilling any day of the week and the assurance that the meals you grill will be juicy and delicious every time.
