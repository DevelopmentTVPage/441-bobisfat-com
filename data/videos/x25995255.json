    "transcripts": "Here's a great last minute appetizer trick when unexpected guests show up. Cut a baguette into thin slices, put them into a zippered bag and freeze. They'll be good for a few weeks in there and then when the guests show up just pull them out of the freezer, put them on a baking sheet, brush with a little olive oil and place under the broiler until golden brown, then flip and brown the other side. And when they come out just top them with pretty much anything you have in the house. For example, tuna with roasted red pepper,  goat cheese and smoked salmon, sauteed rosemary mushroom, ham with grainy mustard, jarred bruschetta mix, tomatoes with avocado,  white bean with a little cayenne, left over steak with arugula and horseradish, ricotta with honey and toasted pine-nuts, and plain salsa. With something this quick and this delicious they'll think you were expecting them. Happy holidays.  ",
