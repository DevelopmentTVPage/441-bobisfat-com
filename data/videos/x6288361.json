Sound familiar? Probably. This time, however, our man is faced with a new challenge: he must compete with his son who is equipped with an ultra-modern crossbow. The prize? A Maverick Victorinox Swiss Army watch.\n\n\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\n\nLaurent Ulrich   Director\nMichel Frutig   Production manager\nDaniel Steffen   Cinematographer\nJulien Humbert-Droz  Camera operator\nDedicam.tv   Arial Shots\nHanspeter Wieland  Gaffer\nPatrick Becker   Sound technician\nPhil Arber                  Making Of\nJehan Radwan   Make-up artist\n\nRichard Bucher   Walter Tell\nPeter Graf           Wilhelm Tell\n\nDino H\u00e4chler   Postproduction\nPatrischa Freuler  Color correction\nMichael Vescovi   Sound engineer\/mastering\nPhil Arber           Sound Composition\n\n\nSpecial thanks to Rosmarie and Bruno Sager for the generous support and the beautiful shooting location.\n\nProduced by Maybaum Film",
