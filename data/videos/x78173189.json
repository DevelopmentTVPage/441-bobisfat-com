Kids enter the bouncer through the dinosaurs mouth, jump around in its belly and leave by sliding down it's tail. The compact design makes the dino bouncer great for year around indoor use, making it easy to keep kids active not matter what the weather. Setting up the dino couldn't be easier, the built in blower turns on with a flip of a switch and the bouncer inflates automatically in under two minutes. You can reverse the blower setting for easy deflating and storage too. When the blower isn't being used the cord packs easy out of the way in the built in storage department. The mesh net enclosure keeps kids safely inside while allowing parents to keep an eye on the action. Only little tikes bouncer are made of heavy duty puncher resistant material that last bounce after bounce and allows two children to play at the same time.
