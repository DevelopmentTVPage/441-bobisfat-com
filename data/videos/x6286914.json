    "transcripts": "So when we're designing a vacuum cleaner we want to make sure it picks up from carpets and hard floors really well using all the standard test metrics. But we also want to make sure that in the real world when you're actually in someone's home the machine performs as well. And one of the really important to look at is to pick up. So you can see there's a really pronounced stride where of the debris that was by the wall has been left behind. It's it's clean almost to the edge. So when we look at the underneath of this machine for example it's easy to see why it doesn't pick up along skirting boards very well on either side of the plate. There's an area where the brush doesn't extend so no brushes going around helping pick up the debris so it gets left behind as you go along the skirting board. We make sure that the brush is as wide as we can possibly get it and the gap here is as narrow as we can make it and that's why the edge because it is so good on our machine.",
