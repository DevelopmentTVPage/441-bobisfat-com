    "transcripts": "Hi I'm Mary Rogers director of marketing communications for cuisinarts this is the cuisinarts stand mixer has lots of great attachments that you can buy separately. One that we're going to talk about right now is our pasta attachment you open the front of your stand mixer and in here is where you can mount the pasta tacksman. It's very easy to do. You just pull on the sliver down here and twist. Until it locks into place. You'll notice I already have one of the selected dyes on here this one happens to make spaghetti and you also have five others. You can go all the way from spaghetti up to small is anya. It's really fun and easy to make pasta dough you can use your mixer to mix the actual day. And then what you do is you can drop the dough in here in about pieces the size of a dime and this will actually extrude your pasta out the front it's comes with lots of other things you have your measuring cup your cleaning tool and your wrench and you won't believe how easy it is to make fresh tender pasta very quickly.",
