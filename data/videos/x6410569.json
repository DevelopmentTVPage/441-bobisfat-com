    "transcripts": "This is the 50-liter Wide-Step Rectangular Step Can. It's the perfect shape for placing up against the wall and out of the way like this. Its extra wide steel pedal makes it easy to step on from almost any angle. And it's very strong. The all steel pedal is engineered to last over 150,000 steps. That's more than 20 steps a day for 20 years. The can itself is made from fingerprint-proof stainless steel. So it'll stay shiny. Notice that as the lid closes, it's quiet. No loud banging or slamming. That's because air dampers inside control the lid's motion so it comes down slowly. Our custom fit Code J liners fit this can perfectly with no overhang. Time to take out the trash.",
