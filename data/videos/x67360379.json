So over here we have these amazing button mushrooms; these are some beautiful mushrooms. Things can roll around a lot, so you want to find that nice safe spot. So half these. We can use these for kebabs. So what we're gonna do here is slice this buttoned mushroom. Perfect for sauces. This part is a little unstable so we're gonna knock it down and then we're going to come through. We're going to be using this three and half inch pairing knife. So what we're going to do is stem this portabello This is the part you don't want to eat. We're going to keep this portabello whole. This is going to be great for stuffing. So what we're going to do here is slice the other one. You want to keep your fingers back and rock the knife. we'll be using the chef's knife. This is a great knife, has a lot of weight to it and it is very sharp. What we did here is leave our portabello whole and we sliced the other one. We also sliced our mushrooms and quartered the other one. ",
