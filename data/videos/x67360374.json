    "transcripts": "[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nToday I'm going to cut up a pair. I'm going to use a five inch santoku blade. First thing we're going to do is remove the seeds. Santaokus are great, they are designed to cut vegetables and fruit. So removing the core just a 45 degree angle cut. That right there, perfect kids' snack. So the next thing I want to do with this is set it down and we're going to make long slices. We're going to do the same cut again and put it on it's side to make a match stick cut. And then our final cut is going to be taking that matchstick cut and making a small dice or brunoise cut. Again, keeping you're fingers curled behind your knuckle so you don't cut yourself is very important. So here we have our three finished cuts of pair, wedges fro sauteing or snacking, delicious matchstick cuts for salads and brunoise for garnishing or salsa.",
