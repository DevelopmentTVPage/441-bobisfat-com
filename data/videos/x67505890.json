    "transcripts": "[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nImagine black bean and Monterrey jack quesadillas with fresh pico de gallo. Now imagine you made the tortilla by yourself. four simple ingredients in a tortilla, you can either cut it together by hand or in the foot processor. It comes together in these beautiful little balls. You can roll it out nice and thin almost transparent. Now while I'm rolling these out, I'm going to preheat the international chef turning the timer up to \"Tortilla\" and the heat to full temperature. I'm going to close it up. Allow it to preheat and get these rolled up. With all my favorite ingredients inside, tomato, pico de gallo, fresh cilantro, I'll finish with another layer of pepper jack cheese. It acts like the glue to keep this beautiful quesadilla together. Top on, slide it right back on to the grill plates, close it up, and let all that cheese melt. There's no need to wait for Cinco de Mayo for these beautiful quesadillas.",
