        "hookText": "Alongside the limited numbered series launch in titanium comes this classic model in grinded stainless steel (316 L), a fully-outfitted high-function chronograph as fail-safe and robust as the limited edition.\n\nFaithful to the rigorous requirements of military engineering, the new Airboss chronograph has the same dimensions (42 mm) as the limited edition and the same automatic winding mechanical movement--the famously reliable Valjoux 7750. It complements a collection that already has the classic three-hand model presented in 2010 and the power reserve version launched in 2012. \n\nhe guiding watchwords behind the refined new design are: simple aesthetics, robustness, precision and perfect readability across all functions. The dial, in anthracite gray or white silver, is wide open, with oversized numbers and long, luminescent central hands (hours and minutes), both topped with the chronograph second hand. As it should be at Victorinox Swiss Army, military time has not been forgotten, and is stamped on a central circle. \n\nTimekeeping functions are operated in the traditional manner, with the two oblong buttons on each side of the crown. The 30 minute counter is at 12 o'clock, the 12 hour counter is at 6, the small seconds is at 9; and the date window is at 3.\n\nTwo looks are available: with environmentally responsible brown leather strap or a stainless steel bracelet. Whatever your choice, these models of refined aesthetics are perfect companions for life.",
