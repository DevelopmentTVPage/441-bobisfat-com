    "transcripts": "Introducing our newest patent-pending innovation in guaranteed fog free shower mirrors. The Z'Fogless water mirror, the perfect accessory for your shaving routine. Daily shaving can irritate skin leaving red bumps, cuts and razor burn. Steam and hot water from the shower softens hairs and opens pores, letting you get the closest, cleanest shave possible without irritation. Whether you're shaving or removing makeup, regular mirrors just can't hold up to the heat and steam in a shower and will fog in just a few minutes. Zadro's water mirror technology uses hot water to raise the mirror's surface temperature to that of the shower, guaranteeing the elimination of fog build up. The Z'fogless water mirror easily installs to almost any shower in three separate ways - use Zadro's patented extra strength double suction cups to mount to smooth surfaces, adhere it to the wall with the included double stick tape, or add the security of silicon mounting to the double stick tape for extra strength. The mirror is highly durable and break resistant, making it perfectly safe to use in the shower. Insert three AA batteries inside the base to power the four super bright LED lights and get the light you need in the shower. When you're finished shaving, place your razor in the convenient accessory holder, big enough to fit any blade you may have. Sizing up at eleven inches tall and six inches wide, the Z'fogless Water Mirror's sleek design is perfect for any shower. When choosing your next fogless shower mirror, remember the name that started it all Z'Fogless. First in Fogless.",
