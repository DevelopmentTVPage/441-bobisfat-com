Simple & lightweight, yet very powerful and it works extremely well on picking up pet hair.  It is very easy to take apart and clean and all canisters can be washed out with water.  The Hepa filter is reusable and can also be washed and cleaned like brand new.  That is a very good feature because it is a pain to keep buying new filters and keeping extra filters on hand.  There is no need to do that with this Dirt Devil Pet Vacuum.  All the vacuum filters are permanent and reusable & washable.   This is a very strong, powerful pet vacuum and also very lightweight and easy to maneuver.   This Dirt Devil vacuum has no problem picking up and vacuuming up & removing all cat, dog or pet hair from carpets, drapes, furniture or upholstery. \n\nVisit\nhttp:\/\/putinthecat.blogspot.com\/\n\nPutin the Cat receives the Lakhovsky Healing Ring \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uDJV-Oncvg0\n\nCat Health - Distilled Water & Colloidal Silver \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LM_729I4wGc\n\n'Putin' the Cat has a Pyramid Power Breakfast \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NJpIFdm0llI\n\nPutin the Cat in the Florida High Grass \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QarTB1y3ThI\n\nEthical Treatment of Cats & Pets and Karma \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZtGs3JBmjac\n\nPutin the Cat, \"Hunting\" for a Tiny Lizard \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dD0kOW2cfNY\n\nYou You want a Dog-like Cat, get an 'Aby' \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FfRE9MWcSVk\n\nMr. Putin the Cat is no. 1 \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=k2GoLllXlJI\n\nPutin the Cat, Like a little dude \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Y0JelXJzHGQ\n\nGenetically Modified Sugar Destroyed by Vigilantes \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gkq-nn1KqDU \n\nBlue Abyssinian cat - half asleep \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=emaLlS4eb6s\n\n'Indoor Cat' Uses the Cat Park \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mpb9S-zkUJk\n\nPutin the Cat, Secret Weapon Against the NWO \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cFY7Q-9vQKI\n\nPutin the Cat tries a Car Ride \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nXCS3MXwkrY\n\nPutin the Cat is 1 Today,Jun-7-2013 \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2OLS8vFG0C0\n\n\"Putin\" the cat Climbed Way Up 6-4-2013 \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ol7OiBWwUKQ\n\nPutin in the Cat Park & On the Cat Tower \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cfljyll8an4\n\nLoyal Like a Dog: Putin the Cat \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4xuzEtK3oDE\n\nPutin the Cat Likes to Sleep in the Sink \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Myi7i9YZ070\n\nPutin the Cat's health supplements \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=t4ywESR_wLw\n\nPutin the Tax Cat on Tax Havens \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mXvb_YSbaL8\n\nHarness for Putin the Cat \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=R0DmO6hpu1s",

And if you only use it for the three sort of couch or anything and I'm going to tell you one thing it's really good about this. You don't have to buy any filters. It's like. Everything in here is just all releasable and washable has like. And main filter is a cartridge. It just snaps out you turn it out in you wash it out you'll need to replace anything. Very easy to do. Works like crazy for a powerful. Vacuum in was a new much money to just snap together snap together a few seconds. Put together but you know I just think you are just going to squeeze and just turn this. On a talk. This guy walks.
