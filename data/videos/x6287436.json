    "transcripts": "I really love lamb shoulder you know why it's got so much flavor and texture to it so it's it's a piece of meat that is kind of ignored. We take the mote out of it and we're just adding a marinate. If you will on it's its must turn over and we spread that on the interior of the wound and let that sit for 24 hours. We trust it and then we were going to roast a pan roasted to get a really nice crust on it you know take that out and they were going out our vessels I like one pot cooking. So this is this is one of those recipes where your whole dinner order a whole meal is prepared in the one rondo and the rondo is such a beautiful piece to use for this and then we put the land back on top and roasted till it reaches the internal temperature about 1\/31\/32 and then with an take it out let it rest for about a half an hour so that the tempter comes up to about 135. During that time to finish our vegetables I just finished cutting them off a little more give me a little more golden color to them not a lot of the seasoning to it some salt constant herb's of open water and then finish with our sauce make a little bit of a reduction and adding your lamb into that and then by that time we're ready to go and enjoy this wonderful purebred.
