Because we're making pumpkin mac and cheese. \n\n[MUSIC PLAYING] \n\nIn a pan add flour to melted butter and stir well to combine. Then stir in milk, mixing until slightly thickened. Add Dijon mustard, shredded Monterrey Jack and white cheddar cheeses, sauteed onions, pumpkin puree, a pinch of cayenne, and season to taste with salt and pepper. \n\nLet everything thicken beautifully, then add the cooked pasta. Combine and put into an oven proof dish. In a nonstick pan add bread crumbs to melted butter, mix well, and put on top of the macaroni. Place into a 350 degree oven, and bake about 30 minutes or until golden brown. Rich, pumpkin-y, and delicious. \n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]",
