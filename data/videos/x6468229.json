    "transcripts": "Hi, I'm Nancy from Bed Bath and Beyond, and I'm here to tell you about the Jelly Belly manual ice shaver. This ice shaver let's you make refreshing fun and easy snow cones the whole family can enjoy. It comes with two ice molds and a no mess drip tray. Remember to make some extra ice molds and store them in your freezer. Then you'll be ready to make homemade snow cones any time. Making homemade snow cones is so easy. Let's make a snow cone now. Place the ice from the ice mold into the machine and put the mold cup underneath to catch the ice shavings then put the lid on the machine. Press down turning clockwise until it's tight. To shave the ice, just turn the handle while pressing down. Now you can add your favorite syrup. It makes snow cones using either Jelly Belly flavored syrups, your favorite soda, punch, or fruit juice. Snow cone cups and straws are available separately. The Jelly Belly Manual Ice Shaver is available online and at a Bed Bath and Beyond store near you.",
