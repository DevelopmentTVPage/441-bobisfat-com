    "transcripts": "[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nA sandwich is a beautiful thing, simple and comforting. I've got some fresh ingredients here and it's gonna be easy to throw them together, put them on the panini press and get nice results. The great thing is I can assemble a couple of really big sandwiches up to four. The thing I love about this panini press is there is an adjustment right here on the side. It allows me to account for the thickness of the sandwich so I'm not squeezing it too much. the other thing is I can just simply pop this and look at that, I've got a perfect press. Allowing me to get equal pressure across the sandwich giving me great grill marks nice and crispy on the outside and melted and moist and delicious on the inside. Look at that, they're crispy, they're all melted and gooey. You add a little bit of heat to some cheese and bread and you have the perfect lunch.",
