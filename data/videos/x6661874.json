    "transcripts": "If you've been hanging out with us for even a little while, you'll know we've made some great stuff on the grill. A flat iron steak with chimichurri sauce. Veggies and fish in a grill basket. Teriyaki meatballs. And even a super delicious beer-braised bratwurst. But now it's time for something a little different. And we're making a 5 Spice Grilled Chicken. \n\n5 Spice, which you can get in the spice aisle of the supermarket, is a wonderful blend of-- you guessed it-- five different spices that make for amazing Asian flavor. Just mix it well with brown sugar and soy sauce and pour it over the chicken to marinade. Save a little for serving. If you have an hour to let it marinade, fine. If you have four hours, great. Overnight even better. \n\nThen it just goes on the grill and is cooked until done and beautiful on both sides. I like to serve it with some chopped green onion and some toasted sesame seeds. Basically four ingredients, but it tastes like 40. Thank you 5 Spice.",
