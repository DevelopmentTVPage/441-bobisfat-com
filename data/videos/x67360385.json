Of course I like to prefer a six inch utility knife, something that has a little flex so that I can get this peel down. I'll show you how. Get a nice flat surface and then go all the way down. This is what's great about these utility knives, they got a nice flex to them, very sharp. Of course I like to bring out my chef's knife for any other application. Got a nice flat surface. Gonna go right down the center. Now see how i'm just using my top hand, this is for safety. Push downright in half. Let's get it nice and chunky, easy for a salad. Traditionally, the best way, I find, is to cut this guy for pickle down at half. Flat surface and down half again. Come across and just get a little rocking motion. And you basically want to follow your fingers, let them guide you. Alright so we got our slices for pickling, got nice chunks for a salsa or for a stew.",
