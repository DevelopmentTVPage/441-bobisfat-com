The hand-held tool easily cores the center of little treats and ejects the center in one piece, so you can cut it in half to top off the cupcake. The soft, non-slip grip is comfortable, even during repetitive coring, and the large handle makes it easy and fun for kids to use. The Corer comes apart for cleaning and is dishwasher safe.",

With so many fans of cupcakes in the office, we decided to elevate our cupcake skills with a handy cupcake corer. This handy tool allows you to quickly and comfortably remove the center of a cupcake or muffin in order to fill ti with cream, frosting, or preserves. Simply push the cupcake corer onto the top of the pastry, twist it to remove the center, and eject it using the comfortable dome button. Slice the removed core in half to replace the top of your cupcake before icing it. And it also comes apart for easy cleaning. Here's a good tip. Don't stop with jsut cupcakes and sweet muffins. Use your cupcake corer on savory muffins to stuff them with cheese, spreads, and other delights.",
