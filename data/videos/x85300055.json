    "transcripts": "Hi I'm Esmeralda and today we're going to look at the NewAir AH 450B, this heater is the modern update on the classic radiator heaters you can see that its like a radiator but has a slim portable design which makes it easy to move around. For its small size it's pretty powerful it can heat up for room about a hundred fifty square feet that's like a medium sized bedroom or like a den. We've had a reviewer say that this heater can heat up open areas, large open areas like kitchen or maybe a patio. There's a timer on it you can set it to go off after you've gone to sleep or maybe after you've been out of the house for a while it has a setting for up to 10 hours. We've got good reviews that heats up the room quickly and it's not overly hot to the touch. It's super quiet it has no moving parts it just heats up the oil that's inside the fence and it circulates. It's all enclosed so there's no burning smell like a lot of heaters tend to have. It's got this spot for the cord where you can wrap it up and keep it out of the way when it's not in use during the off-season. There is a really good safety feature built into it so if he gets knocked over it would automatically turn off, it's really good if you have kids running around your house and there's an overheat switch so it will automatically shut off if it senses that it's getting warmer than it should be. The display is easy to see even comes with a remote control so you can adjust it without having to get up and go over to it. Thank you for checking out the AH 450B space heater from NewAir.",
