    "transcripts": "Introducing new rust proof aluminum Turn-n-Lock bath storage from InterDesign. Turn-N-Lock products provide maximum strength hold with out the need for tools or hardware. In addition, aluminum's rust proof properties keep the finish looking new. Before installing Turn-n-Lock products, clean your shower surface and suction cups with a damp cloth. Allow the shower's air surface to air dry completely. To install, loosen knobs by turning counter clock wise. Until they stop. When positioning, slide the cups to avoid any grout lines. Push cups firmly against the shower surface while turning knobs counter clockwise to tighten until they stop. The turn and lock technology is now in full force. To remove, simply turn the knobs counter clockwise and lift away from the surface. InterDesign's turn and lock products are rust proof and will look new in years to come. Mix and match a variety of styles to customize your shower organization. InterDesign, what's next now.",
