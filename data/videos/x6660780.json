Do you really want to be standing in your kitchen cooking the whole time? \n\nIf you're anything like me, you don't. So I say, you make something simple, so you're not in the kitchen the whole time. You make something delicious, so your guests are happy, and you make something still New Year's Eve worthy. \n\nMy suggestion? Curried shrimp. And before you judge me on that, just watch this. \n\n[MUSIC PLAYING] \n\nIn a medium pot, melt butter. Add flour, salt and pepper, paprika, and curry powder. Mix well, and it will be a thick, dry paste. Stir in milk, and let it thicken slowly. \n\nThen add bay shrimp. They're the small, already cooked little guys you buy from your fishmonger. And finally add ketchup and dry sherry. Stir well and heat through. \n\nAnd I like to have those little puff pastry shells with the removable top cooked and ready to go so your guests can simply make their own when they're hungry. And whether you keep the shrimp warm in a crock pot or a pot on the stove, it's all simple, delicious, and definitely New Year's Eve worthy. \n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]",
