So first like any cabbage, a brussel sprout will have waxy tough leafs on the outside so taking them off is ideal. Next, I'm going to use a pairing knife because I like the control of it, like another finger at my hand, to core out the base of this brussel sprout like a cone. I'm left with very delicate pedals that are really nice for salads. Next brussel sprout, I'll cut out the base in the same way. This chef knife has a little bit more weight, so as your slicing through and cutting with the back end, you can really push through the hard center. And then I like to cut these into thirds. And last we're gonna do the same thing and cutting off the end and this will be a small very thin slice and then just that rocking motion back and forth. As it's nice and sharp it will glide through those leaves really easily. And here we have brussel sprouts three ways. Wedges for roasting, slice for pan fry, and pedals for salad.",
