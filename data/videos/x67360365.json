Now utilizing a six inch utility knife, I'm going to split the shell down the back barely getting into the shrimp as possible. You just want to split the shells and take it off. So next step we're going to do is remove the shell. So now we're going to take our six inch utility knife and we're going to make two different cuts. First cut we're simply going to split these is half. This is great for sauteing just like that. The second cut we're going to do is fora ceviche or a seafood cocktail. We're just going to make thin slices. and here we have shrimp cut two ways, thinly sliced for sauteing and roughly chopped for ceviche.",
