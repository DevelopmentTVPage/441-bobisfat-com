    "transcripts": "In this video I'll show you how I style my beard using the Braun beard trimmer. I've grown out my beard for a few days so first I need to trim and even it out. First I set the precision of my trimmer using the precision dial, it has up to 20 length setting to .5 to 20 millimeters with .5 millimeters steps for maximum precision. Next I use the lock functions to secure my desire length setting, once locked it's time for me to trim my beard. Now that my beard is even and trimmed, it's time to give it a precise define style to achieve this I use the detailed trimmer. I push this button to raise the blade and use it to shave my edges of my beard. I tend to edge out my beard in four steps, I first start by defining the contours of my neck, second I edge out my sideburns, third I edge out the contour of my cheek to give my beard a nice defined look, lastly I trim the area above and below my lip and I do one last check to make sure my beard is symmetrical. With my beard now precisely style the last step is to clean my trimmer by simply rinsing under running water. It's that simple, that's how I define my style with Braun beard trimmer.",
