    "transcripts": "Hi I'm Brian Carmen I am here in Marietta Georgia I have the Char-Broil Infrared. Winter time I'm out here cooking, summer time I'm out here cooking. But I think I cook just about everything. Breakfast, I cooked a pizza on it. Ribs, Burgers, you\u2019re doing manly things you're grilling meat Neighbors come over. it's just that whole neighborhood feel. Just having the kids down here, they're chasing around after the dogs and to be honest it kind of keeps them out of my hair a little bit when I'm grilling. I love cooking on this grill. Now I'm able to take it to the next level and cook a lot of different types of food. So that it cooks things at a faster pace but it still keeps it juicy. The weirdest thing I've ever cooked on my grill was a jalapeno pizza. It came out really really well because of that infrared in the way that it's heating everything evenly. It does much much better but still keeps the original flavors of whatever you're cooking true to whatever you're cooking. Let\u2019s get this thing fired up. I can cook anything.",
