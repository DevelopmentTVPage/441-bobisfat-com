    "transcripts": "Often referred to as the lifeblood of dorm living, ramen is quick and easy to make. Of course you could always heat and serve the way the package says, but why? Because adding it to any soup about five minutes before serving makes it much more interesting. Not to mention it makes a crunchy addition to any salad. Especially these little broken pieces in the bag. Or after draining, stir in a spoonful of soup, peanut butter, soy sauce, and sesame oil fro a great Thai inspired version. Then there is my favorite - five minute teriyaki noodles. Heat a nonstick pan with a little oil and add diced red pepper. Left soften about five minutes and add the drained ramen. Cook, stirring often until just beginning to get a little crispy and add some bottled teriyaki sauce. Mix well to combine and plate adding diced green onion. Ramen - what's not to love?",
