    "transcripts": "[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nParents let's talk about the talk. You now the talk I'm talking about. It's never too early to start the conversation about wearing protection. Let's just get used to saying the dreaded words aloud, sun exposure. If you're overprotective like me, you might be inclined to panic. Use some scare tactics. The sun can kill you! it causes skin cancer! on Average 354 Americans are diagnosed with skin cancer every hour do you want to be one of them? do you want to be a statistic? do you!? Your goal is to make sure your kids understand the risks and consequences so they always wear protection SPF along with long sleeves, hats, sunglasses. So you and Taylor are going to the beach hu? that's cool, cool, cool. There's gonna be a lot of sun out there. You know what you need to wear right? yes sunscreen and most important of all prepare for the talk by making sure you're setting up a good example. Hu? what am I doing? just putting on my sunscreen you know like mommy does every morning. You know most people make the mistake of putting on too little but every application should be about one ounce for your body. I don't know. It's about the size of a golf ball or a shot glass. That's a whole another talk. See that wasn't so bad right? You can do this. Go talk to your kids about the sun. and like I said set an example for your kids. make sure you show them you're putting sunscreen on everyday. ",
