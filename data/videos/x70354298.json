    "transcripts": "I love the power air fryer because I love fried foods all kinds of fried foods, but it can be such a pain to fry your foods and also everyone's always telling you they're unhealthy, fried foods are bad for you, but now that I found the power airfryer it has made a huge difference. First of all, the cooking is so easy to do. There's two compartments that I can use. It's not messy; the cleanup doesn't take hours. I just put in my favorite food which is fried chicken and it's ready. You know the power airfryer also steams, it's saut\u00e9s, it roasts, and of course it fries. Who would think that a fryer could do all of these things and that the food could taste so good and be so much healthier for you. And you don't have all the mess in the cleanup the power airfryer has done a world of good for me and my family and in my kitchen and allowed me to do so many of the things that took so long to do. I can do it all in the power air fryer.",
