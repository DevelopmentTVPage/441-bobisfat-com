    "transcripts": "A simple vinaigrette is the key to great eating. Combine three parts olive oil with two parts white wine vinegar, a squeeze of lemon juice, and season with salt and pepper. Mix well, and you're done. \n\nOr for a different version, also add one clove of crushed garlic and a tablespoon of Dijon mustard. And it's even better when you stir in chopped herbs and finely diced shallots. Start with the basic version and take it anywhere you want. You'll be eating better in no time.",
