    "transcripts": "Okay so Thanksgiving is just a few days away and at this point you should probably have everything in place but that doesn't mean I'm not gonna have any last minute advice. And the first tip is to brine your turkey. Think of it as marinating the turkey in a sweet salty liquid for about a day before cooking and the result is a really moist super delicious bird. That's why it's number one but number two is the gravy and I'm suggesting you make the one we showed you in a earlier video because it maybe the best gravy I ever had. And yes it's a little more work than buying gravy but the gravy goes on almost every thing so shouldn't it be the best. Okay the next tip is for your stuffing and this tip is simple. I always add more onion and celery than the recipe calls for and also some dry sage and rosemary, it's really all about flavor. Okay next potatoes and I don't want you to over think these but I really believe mashed are the way to go and look we've shown you how to make really good mashed potatoes in a previous video but I always like to add to them. And whether it's truffle oil, blue cheese, bacon or even blue cheese and bacon it's all good and they will definitely have your guest talking but in a good way. Okay that is it, here's the key relax have fun and remember a turkey is really just a big chicken, it's easy to cook. Have a great Thanksgiving.",
