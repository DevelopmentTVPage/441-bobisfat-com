We have a chef's knife and a pairing knife. First thing I want to do, I want to cut through all these leaves and get rid of the top. Before I jump to pairing knife, I'm going to do a little work with my hands just removing top outer leaves. Next thing I'm going to do is take a pairing knife and trim back. Peeling it down almost like you would an apple. We're going to remove the rest of these leaves to expose the end of the heart. Now, get a quarter of this, utilizing our pairing knife again. And then we're going to take the tip of the knife and remove the choke scraping this out. So here we have one artichoke, trimmed, cleaned, and ready to cook.",
