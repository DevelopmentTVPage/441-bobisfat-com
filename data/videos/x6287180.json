    "transcripts": "When we started developing our cordless. We didn't realize what we were creating the challenge we were presented was to create a cordless full sized cyclonic vacuum that would clean your whole house. We started thinking about how to make it stick back stronger. But that wasn't going to make anything really new we needed to flip our approach we need to do is make a great vacuum and then take away the corn that was until I had one of the first prototypes in my home until I realized what we had done I was cleaning a lot. It seemed like such a silly thing of course but not having to plug it in run it out and replug it in when I went to another room the cord was actually keeping me from cleaning. Felt so good to not have to deal with it with their cordless. When I saw a mess I cleaned it and other people my family started cleaning more too. It's amazing to be a part of something that makes me rethink what I do everything clean.",
