    "transcripts": "you find lucky enough to work out for 30 minutes, it needs to be efficient and fun. that's why I love the proform hybrid trainer. It's an elliptical and recumbent bike all in the same machine. It's easy to adjust the pedals and console the built-in tablet holder let me access all my favorite TV shows and fitness apps while I work out. One app I can't live without is iFit.  It already came built into my hybrid trainer so now I can draw routes on google maps and choose a new workout every day. When I exercise I prefer a full-body approach. I just grab hold of the resistance arms and immediately my upper body and core are engaged. At first I started with a low resistance level but now I can really turn it up for a better workout. I really like the console power meter. With just one number, it shows me how hard I'm actually working and no workout is complete without my favorite music. With the hybrid trainer, I don't have to worry about annoying ear plug cords. The built-in speakers let me turn it up and go each workout feels fresh and fun with my hybrid trainer. It's more than a bike and more than an elliptical it's exactly what I've been looking for.",
