    "transcripts": "Hi it's a livia from Hoover. Before you take your steam that carpet washer back we had no idea that could help get it working again. OK first put it in power scrub mode like this. Lay the machine on its back and remove the brushes. It should be pretty easy to pull them straight out like this. Make sure you can twirl the brushes with your fingers and also check this pen here to make sure it's not cracked or broken. If all that is OK but the brushes back on next. Lift the unit back up and recline the handle like this. Then remove this lid. I want you to lift this panel door up as high as it will go about this far. Then push it firmly back in. Now put the lid back on and lift the handle back up then turn it on. Hopefully you'll see the brush is spinning and the unit but if it doesn't happen you can take a closer look at it and we can say this. Hope that helps.",
