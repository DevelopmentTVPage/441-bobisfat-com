This comes with a removable cup holder. So you can use snow cone cups or your own cups. It has an adjustable blade and you know master tray it comes with two ice molds 20 snow cone cups. And straws. Making homemade snow cones it's so easy. Let me show you how to do it now. Place the bowl on top of the base and turn the knob to select either finer shavings. Put the high. In the bowl. Now put the motor on top of the ice and plug-in the machine. Press the power button down while applying steady downward pressure. Thank you. The motor will start and ice will begin to shave. Just take your hand off the power button to stop the machine. When you're done shaving the ice just add your favorite syrup and enjoy. It because the shaved ice is so fine. It immediately absorbs the flavor giving you a truly intense taste all the way through. This electric eye makes no sense using either jelly bellies flavored syrup soda or fruit juice.
