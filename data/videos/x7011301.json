Drizzle melted butter in the bottom of the baking dish and top with a layer of store bought frozen cheese Blintzes. In a bowl, combine sour cream, beaten eggs, vanilla, sugar, and orange liqueur. Mix well and our over blintzes. Bake at a 250 degree oven for approximately 45 minutes. While they bake, combine blueberries, sugar, and lemon juice in a small pot over medium heat until slightly thick; about 10 minutes. When the Blintzes are brown on top, remove from oven, plate, and serve with blue berry sauce.",
