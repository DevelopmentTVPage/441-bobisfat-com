    "transcripts": "Ceviche is fish that has been essentially cooked in lemon or lime juice and it's perfect to make ahead of time and take where ever you're going. Slice sea bast into a smallish dice and then put into a bowl. And if you don't like sea bast, then fine use halibut or mahi mahi or red snapper or even shrimp and scallops. Pretty much anything you like. It's that simple. Then just add diced red onion, cucumber, seeded and chopped Serrano peppers, tomatoes, cilantro, kosher salt, and fresh ground pepper and lot's of lime juice. Mix really well. And what's cool is that under the next hour, the acid and the lime juice will really cook the fish. It's really cool. And when it's ready you can eat it by itself because it's delicious or you could take it with tostadas, spread on some mayo, add some ceviche, and then eat that. Ceviche, no just amazingly delicious, but the perfect summer thing to make and take.",
