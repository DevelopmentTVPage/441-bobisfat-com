    "transcripts": "Let's talk about why you should track sleep. Good sleep is the ultimate life hack. It refreshes repairs, and renergizes you, yet most of us still overlook sleep. Why? it's just history repeating itself. Up until the 1950s, people thought exercise was actually bad for you. But science guided us to use scales and monitor weight. That gave us direction. We learned that tracking actually leads to improvement. But why not track sleep? Well, people have tried. Some suggested wearing sensors on our head, chest, wrist, even finger or sleeping with your phone. Yeah... pass. We at Beddit finally got it right. First, we nailed the hard sleep science. Then, we aced the bedroom zen. We made sleep tracking as easy as stepping on a weight scale. Just sleep on Beddit and that's all you have to do. Just put the Beddit under you bed sheet and sleep. In the morning, Beddit's unique SleepScore will show you how you slept. No more guesswork. You'll just know. And you'll know how to take it from there.",
