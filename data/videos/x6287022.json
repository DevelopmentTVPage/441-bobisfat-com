    "transcripts": "Welcome to Hoover home we want to make sure you get the best performance out of your steam backspin scrub carpet washer. So we've created this video to run through set up and usage tips. We'll walk you through the steps to go from box to beautiful carpets in no time when you pull your new cleaner out of the box you'll need to put together some of the pieces. First attach the handle like this. Screw it in then the hose holder in the tool holder. Once they're in place you can store your hosen tools in their appropriate locations ready to start cleaning. So are we. First fill the clean water tank with warm tap water. Then add your detergent according to the mixing instructions on the back of a bottle. Now put the tank onto the cleaner making sure the handle of the tank is pressed upward so it's really secure. Plug-in your steam back turn it on here and press the handle release pedal. You'll want to squeeze the trigger on your cleaner as you slowly push it forward to wash the carpet then release the trigger and pull the cleaner backwards to extract the dirt and dirty water. We hope these tips helped but if you have any more questions let us know.",
