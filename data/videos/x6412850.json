I'll go in the attic and I'm on the roof. Finding some gems up here. Who is this little girl? \n\nStay focused, please. \n\nBingo. Merry Christmas. \n\nJust bring him downstairs. \n\nCome on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you. \n\n[MUSIC PLAYING] \n\nHow's it going up there? Do you have enough lights? \n\nYeah. I don't know if we have enough roof. \n\nYou think a little more snow would make it look real? \n\nOK. So a fall blizzard. \n\n[MUSIC PLAYING] \n\nHey don't eat the decorations. Supposed to be helping. \n\nI am. I'm making a fire. \n\nWell that might be to close to the tree huh? What is that? \n\nIt's mistletoe. Deal with it. \n\nIt's cheating. \n\nYeah, right. \n\n[LAUGHING] \n\nHi did you find everything? I got enough bread to carb load an elephant. I got some overpriced nuts. And some things wrapped in white paper. \n\nAnd some of the tiny pickles. \n\nOnly the tiniest. \n\nCome on. \n\nCome on, Pat. \n\nYou guys aren't even going to give thanks? \n\nReady? \n\nReady. Oh It's beautiful. You know what this gets me in the mood for? \n\nOh absolutely. I can watch this 1,000 times. \n\nMe too.",
