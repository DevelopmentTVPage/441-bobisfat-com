    "transcripts": "At OXO all of our products have a lifetime satisfaction guarantee our salt and pepper grinders are attractive enough to bring to the table that have workhorse durability to stand the test of time in the kitchen our five grind settings lock in place so you'll never get a coarse grind when you set it to fine while the marked on indicators show you what grind you can achieve. A ceramic grinding mechanism crushes peppercorn salt easily and won't ever rust or corrode. The non-slip grip allows you to grind easily even when your hands are wet or oily the grinders positioned at the top of the barrel instead of the bottom so when you're done grinding you won't leave any mess on the counter top or table. The clear barrel shows you when it's time to refill and the large opening at the base allows you to quickly pour in salt or pepper corns without a funnel or a mess. Here's a good tip to use your salt and pepper grinders for other seasonings first grind some salt to clean the mechanism and then fill with dried herbs and spices.",
