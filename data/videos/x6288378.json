    "transcripts": "Charles where else on earth grew up in the backs with no nurse Swiss knife valley. He went to the local high school but his destiny was always on the other side of the mountain. I worked here for 34 years. My father worked here for 17 years. My great father where he is and my great grandfather. Started recording over in 1,900. 84 Victoria Knox makes knives including the most famous pocket knife of all the Swiss army knife. Call outs a no name the company after his mother Victoria. Could turn for stay nice. And we know he came here to Torino. My great grandfather learned profession of knife making and he opened and they had very little heating family at that time he used the power of a little river to dry. He's grinding in Poland. Machines call outs in those first big order came in 891 when the Swiss army commissioned but every soldier. If knife with a little heavy and bulky and therefore profound that if our company decided to bevel a light to more elegant night. Up until then. Pocket knives are just full features and could only spring out of one side of the knife. Really good breakthrough to make this race army knife so compact so function no verdict. Nice little springs. We cheat. They have a lot in 1,997 and we trust the top 10 to 12 897 and this made it possible for the first time. To operate. Their own. Only truth brings. Sicced different. Tools to the bridge through the form which all Victoria knocks my permit today. It's today with the flick. This we saw army knife has 33 the foot in functions but he's still a very small toolbox. Today Victoria Knox employs 1800 people internationally. Half of them work could be the back Swiss factory. They make 120,000 knives a day. That's 25 million a year. All lovingly assembled by hand. Times haven't always been so good. The biggest challenge for us. Mirka Kong to crank over 911 it became very difficult to say look we're nice and we had a core so sales have dropped almost 30 percent over the 90. 911 also has showed us. How dangerous it can be a branding for Comp when you can paint. Only on one product category. Victoria Knox's response expound the brand watches her few luggage and clothing all with the famous logo. I think for trick you know and for our products. Head to head a teacher of sweeps inland we feel very important and a little bit of three Finland beats you for ever.",
