What we're going to do here is peel this ginger using a three and a half paring knife. With our chef's knife we're going to make some planks. WE're gonna use that rocking motion to tuck your fingers back. Make nice strips. That's a Julienne cut right there. What we're also going to do is to break it up and we'll cut it to mountable sizes against the fibers still using that rocking motion. Once we have it here we're just going give a nice little rough mince still tucking those fingers back, very very important. You don't always have to peel your ginger. It depends what you're using it for. So for this we're going to do a nice rough chop. Alright we have our ginger broken down three ways. Here we have the julienne for salads, and here we've got the minced for sauces and marinades, and at the end we have a rough chop for stocks and for teas.",
