Well of course new year's eve can't help, but I can with a very impressive dish that goes from nothing to everything in about 5 minutes cama king crab legs. Put butter in each of 3 small bowls and add minced garlic to 1, chili powder to the other, and fresh ground pepper to the last one. Cut the crab legs into manageable pieces and wrapped in a damp and paper towel and put on a plate. And here's the super simple tip part. We're cooking them in the microwave. Put the plate in the microwave and cook for about 3 minutes. When they're done, take them and replace them with butter and cook until just about melted. Then it's a simple matter of removing the crab and dip it. What do you choose between garlic butter, chilli butter, or black pepper butter? And I went with the chili butter. Sweet tender and amazing. Have a great safe and delicious new years.",
