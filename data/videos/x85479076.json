    "description": "It is important to inspect your child\u2019s pacifier before each and every use. This is not only relevant for teething babies or babies with teeth. Even before babies\u2019 teeth emerge, their gums are very hard and can cause damage to any pacifier.\n\nFor this reason, you need to perform a \u2018pull test\u2019 prior to each use. To perform a \u2018pull test,\u2019 pull the pacifier in all directions. Carefully check for any signs of damage or weakness. If any damage or weakness is found, discard the pacifier immediately.\n\nClean the pacifier before each use under warm running water. Do not use aggressive cleaning agents. Regularly sterilise the pacifier. After sterilising, wait for a further 5 minutes before giving the pacifier to your baby. During cleaning, a small amount of water may enter the nipple. This can be easily expelled by gently squeezing with clean fingers.\n\nNever dip the soother in sweet substances or medication. This can cause tooth decay.For hygiene and safety reasons, always replace the soother after one to two months of use.",
