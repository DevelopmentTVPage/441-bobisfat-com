    "transcripts": "Because shaving heads are subject to wear, they need to be replaced in order to maintain an optimal shaving performance. For maximum shaving performance, we advise you to replace the shaving head of your SensoTouch 3D, but only with an original RQ 12 Philips shaving head. \n\nSome of the SensoTouch 3D models will indicate when to replace its shaving heads by displaying its symbol. This is called the replacement reminder. The replacement reminder will be repeated after each shave until you reset it manually. \n\nThe shaving unit was designed so it could easily be pulled off. So please don't try to turn it. Once the old unit is off, click in the new unit on the shaver. \n\nTo reset the replacement reminder, simply press and hold the on\/off button for more than 10 seconds. The reminder will turn off. And it will then restart monitoring the status of your shaving heads and will remind you when it's time to replace them again.",
