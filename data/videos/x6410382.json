    "transcripts": "After a long day or night in the kitchen, my back aches, my knees ache, and my feet are killing me. It's enough to make a girl want to order takeout. At Cooking Light, we found a solution for stand up fatigue that our test kitchens love, these plush, gel pro kitchen mats. Once you try them, you'll love them too. \n\nWhether your floors are tile, bamboo, or vinyl, these squishy mats actually help prevent stress, fatigue, and physical discomfort. Their gel cores are really helpful if you have knee or joint issues. And even if you don't, their springy softness means you'll feel better, even when you're doing the dishes. \n\nI like the non-slip bottoms, which keep them in place on slick surfaces or floors with spills, and the tapered edges mean no trips, even if you're a kitchen klutz, like me. The gel pro-mats are great for messy cooks too, kids and adults. They're stain and water resistant and clean up easily. Just wipe them off with a wet rag. Plus, they come and find patterns and muted colors, so they'll complement your style and your kitchen. \n\nMost of all, you'll want them in the kitchen to complement your feet.",
