Using the tip of your sharp knife,  you can go down and then rock it down through the back of the more powerful part. Switching to a three and a half inch paring knife is great to kinda core through the center in a V shape. First off, for salads or really light raw preparations and using a very thin cut using your fingers as a guard to kinda shave the fennel off. Secondly, we'll use the other side of the bulb similar to an onion and cut it in a medium dice. It's good to saute this, add it to soups. A lot of Spanish and French recipes use this to add a little aromatics. Moving to the side using a forward back and forth motion. It helps if you have a very sharp knife here.
