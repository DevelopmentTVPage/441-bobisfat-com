    "transcripts": "Easter dinner requires-- no, make that demands-- something special. And a pork loin roast is great, but a bone-in one is really great and special and delicious. \n\n[MUSIC PLAYING] \n\nCombine dried thyme, sage and rosemary, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Mix and set aside. Brush roast lightly with olive oil and sear in a hot oven proof pan on all sides until beautifully brown, then rub with Dijon mustard, and coat with the seasonings. Return to pan and bake, fat side up, about two hours. \n\nOK, so while it cooks I haven't even more special. Potatoes Anna. You are going to love these. Slice potatoes into thin rounds, and melt butter in a small pot with garlic. Butter the bottom and sides of an oven proof pot and layer the potato slices in a circle and brush with the melted butter. \n\nSeason with kosher salt and fresh ground pepper, and then repeat the layering until you're out of potatoes. Top with a final brushing of butter and bake about 45 minutes. When the potatoes are done, remove from the oven and turned upside down onto a cutting board. \n\nWhen the roast is done, remove from the oven then slice the roast and plate with a wedge of the potatoes, topped with sour cream and green onions. I said \"special\", right? Well, this is definitely that. Have a great Easter. \n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]",
