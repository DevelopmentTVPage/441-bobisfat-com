It's an edgy, on trend look you can get using #GarnierStyle.\n\nFollow these steps to get the look:\n\n1. Before flatironing, spray dry hair evenly with Flat Iron Perfector to protect against heat damage, prevent breakage and ensure lasting sleek. Flatiron your hair until it's smooth and straight. \n\n2. Use a flat brush to brush your hair into a high pony, smoothing out any bumps. Spray the top of your hair with Sheer Set Hairspray to prevent static and create a sleek look. Secure the pony with a hair elastic.\n\n3. Take a piece of hair from the ponytail and wrap it around the base of the pony, then secure it with a bobby pin.\n\n4. Complete the look by spritzing your hair with Sheer Set Hairspray. It will smooth fly-always around your face with lasting sleek and hold that won't feel sticky or stiff.",
