    "description": "The iRobot Braava Floor Mopping Robot automatically dry- and damp-mops hard floors using two cleaning modes, keeping dirt and dust under control. Braava uses disposable or reusable cleaning cloths that are simple to attach and remove. The robot is easy to use. At the push of a button, Braava is off to mop for you -- and when it is done cleaning, the robot returns to where it started. It is whisper quiet, featuring a soft-touch bumper and quiet motors, so it cleans without disrupting daily activity or sleep.",
