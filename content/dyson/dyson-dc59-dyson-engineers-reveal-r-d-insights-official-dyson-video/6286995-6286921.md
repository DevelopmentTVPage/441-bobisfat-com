    "description": "Dyson engineers have developed a lightweight, compact cordless vacuum that sucks up as much dust as a conventional vacuum. Without the hassle of a cord*. How did they do it?\n\n100 prototypes were created for Dyson DC59 vacuum cleaner. These prototpyes were then subjected to 636 different validation tests. On\/off buttons punched 20,000 times. Prototypes drop tested 10,000 times. Cleaner heads slammed into iron table legs. And every 100th bin off the production line is whacked with a lump hammer just to make sure.",
