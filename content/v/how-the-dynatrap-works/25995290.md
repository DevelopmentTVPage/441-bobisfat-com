    "title": "How the DYNATRAP Works",
    "description": "The DYNATRAP offers a 3-way protection plan for insect elimination. First, UV fluorescent bulbs produce warm light to attract insects to the DYNATRAP. Second, an exclusive coating of titanium dioxide (TiO2) inside Dynatrap produces carbon dioxide (CO2), which is irresistible to mosquitos. Third, the insects are lured to the powerful vacuum fan, where they are collected and trapped into the retaining cage away from the area of usage providing the user safe pest protection and comfortable living quarters.",
