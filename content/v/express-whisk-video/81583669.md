It enables you to mix ingredients effortlessly: all you have to do is lightly press the handle to turn the whisk effortlessly.\n\nIts flexible wires enable it to change shape.

Made from silicone, it is nonslip to insure stable movement and scratchproof so as not to scratch your pans or containers. \n\nThe Express Whisk stands upright to avoid contact with your work surface and to keep your kitchen clean.\n\nOur Express Whisk can be used for hot or cold mixtures.",
