    "description": "The easy-to-use OXO Good Grips Bladed Meat Tenderizer improves the taste and tenderness of meat, reducing cooking time in the process. When marinating, small holes created by its 50 sharp blades serve as pockets for flavorful juices to fully absorb into meat or poultry in less time -- no need for overnight marinating! This Bladed Meat Tenderizer helps poultry self-baste, allows meat to retain its natural juices and promotes uniform cooking. The contoured shape with non-slip grip is comfortable to hold while stamping, and the clear base makes it easy to see the indent left in the meat for easy, even tenderization. The Bladed Meat Tenderizer locks with the blades covered for safe, compact storage. This tool comes apart for easy cleaning and is top-rack dishwasher safe.",
