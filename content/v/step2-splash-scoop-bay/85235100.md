Toddlers will enjoy all the aquatic features of this activity table as you fill it with sand and water so kids can experience imaginative and sensory play! The plastic mountain cover of this kid's activity table acts as a fun waterfall; plus there is a water tower that can be used both when the cover is and is not intact. The Splash & Scoop Bay provides children with hours of endless outdoor fun on those long summer days.",
