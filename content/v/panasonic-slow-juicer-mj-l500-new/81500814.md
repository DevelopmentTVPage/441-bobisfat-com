    "description": "The Panasonic Slow Juicer is able to produce high nutrient juice with its low speed grinding system (the screw rotates slowly at 45rpm to squeeze ingredients thus nutrients are not destroyed by friction heat. This is a highly efficient way to obtain nutrients.) There is no heat and no oxidation during the juicing process thus preserving the nutrition and enzyme in its original form. The Slow Juicer can also produce delightful frozen dishes with its 'Frozen Attachment' by following a few simple steps.",
