    "description": "Introducing Pampers\u2019 smallest diaper ever, because #TouchesOfLove are important to a premature baby. Pampers Swaddlers is the #1 choice of hospitals*, and our preemie diapers are designed with NICU nurses to wrap babies in a loving touch.\n\nUnder the Pampers Touches of Love campaign this fall, we\u2019ve joined forces with the March of Dimes, the only national organization dedicated to finding the causes of preterm birth. Together, we\u2019ll celebrate all babies, especially the ones in the NICU, and those who care for them. Starting today through World Prematurity Day (November 17), we are inviting everyone to celebrate babies by sharing pictures of your baby\u2019s #touchesoflove moments with @Pampers on Twitter & Facebook and @PampersUS on Instagram. For every post using #touchesoflove, we\u2019ll make a $1 donation to the March of Dimes.** \n\nPampers Preemie Swaddlers, our smallest diapers ever, are designed for premature babies.",
