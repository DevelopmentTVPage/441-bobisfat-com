    "description": "In 1782, the eagle became the official emblem for the new American union. Today, he's spreading his broad wings to take alight on the rooftop of your larger home, garage, cupola, or barn. Our Good Directions' artisans use Old World techniques to handcraft this fully functional, standard-size weathervane that's unsurpassed in style, quality and durability, and carries the logo of the highly prestigious Smithsonian\u00ae Collection! A great gift for wildlife enthusiasts!",
