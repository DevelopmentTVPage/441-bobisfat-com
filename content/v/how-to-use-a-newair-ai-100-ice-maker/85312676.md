    "description": "We demonstrate how to use a NewAir AI-100 ice maker. Learn how it produces ice for drinks, sodas, and anything else.\n\nThe NewAir AI-100 series is the premier ice machine on the market. It can make a batch of ice cubes in as little as 6-15 minutes, up to 28 pounds of ice per day. The process is automatic. Simply add water and the ice maker does the rest. We walk you through every step. We show you how to select ice cube size, tip for filling the reservoir, and demonstrate you how easy it is to keep ice on hand all day long, for pool parties, friendly get-togethers, and lazy afternoons at home.",
