    "description": "Sweet. Tangy. Savory. Satisfying. Just a few of the sensations your tongue will dance around if your new Unison Nonstick-Sear 6-qt. Saut\u00e9 Pan should take on the humble pork chop. Seared side by side with farm-fresh peaches on the wide, flat bottom, the chop begins to find its glory. Turn up the heat and our specially-textured Sear Nonstick surface seals in the succulence of the meat. Pop this versatile pan in the oven to heat through, and finally, plate with sage leaves and a drizzle of honey. Heavenly.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.calphalon.com\/yourset",
