    "description": "At Samsonite, we don\u2019t just help you carry things. Sure, the \u2018things\u2019 in your backpacks, business bags and luggage are often inanimate objects but they are so much more than just things. They\u2019re tools, hopes, dreams, inspirations and ambitions. People use Samsonite to carry their world around with them as they go about conquering it. That\u2019s what we carry. We carry ways for people to get to the places they need to go \u2014 in life and their careers. So no, we don\u2019t just carry things. #WeCarryTheWorld",
