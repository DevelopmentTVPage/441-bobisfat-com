    "description": "One of the main problems people encounter when heating food in a microwave is that the container used can become very hot. If this container is unsuitable for the task it can be dangerous to remove and handle it. The M-Cuisine\u2122 cool-touch bowl however is different. It has a double-walled construction that ensures the outside surface remains cool after heating, allowing you to handle it straight from the microwave \u2013 no need for a tea towel or oven gloves. Perfect for heating up soups or stews, it has a splash-proof lid with a steam vent to reduce mess, and its stylish design means you can take it straight to the table.",
