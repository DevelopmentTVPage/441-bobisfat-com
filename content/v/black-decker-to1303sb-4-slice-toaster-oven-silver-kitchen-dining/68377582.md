    "description": "This is a reasonably capable toaster oven. It toasts bread relatively evenly and is an easy alternative to using my full-sized oven for re-heating small items. Even though there is only a single heating element on the top and bottom, it does a good job. The toaster oven comes with a crumb tray for the bottom, a wire rack and a drip tray\/baking pan.\n\nIt has 4 modes: warm, broil, bake, toast. In warm and broil mode, only the top heating element is used, In bake and toast mode, both heating elements are used.",
