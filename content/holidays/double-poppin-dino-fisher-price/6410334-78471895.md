    "description": "This adorable dino takes ball-poppin' fun to a whole new level! Spin the roller to bring the dynamic dinosaur to life with silly sounds, fun music, and two levels of ball-jumping action. When baby drops the balls through the dino's back, tail or belly, the balls will bounce up, down & all around--making fun sounds and tunes as they go! The balls can pop out of dino's mouth...or tail...or  belly... Little wiggle worms will have a ball crawling and chasing after them to start the fun all over again. Grasping and dropping balls into the dino for put-and-take play help promote baby\u2019s fine motor skills and eye-hand coordination. And when balls pop out of the dino, baby can crawl after them, giving gross motor skills a healthy workout, too!",
