    "description": "Hard packed ice cream has met its match with this OXO Good Grips Beak Ice Cream Scoop. The unique aluminum beak shape has a thin tip to break into hard ice cream, curved side edges to roll perfectly round scoops and large capacity to satisfy big appetites. While our Beak Ice Cream Scoop has non-stick coating for easy release, for extra sticky ice cream try the ejector button and watch ice cream glide off the Beak Ice Cream Scoop and into your bowl. Even soft ice cream and yogurt ends up in your bowl, not sticking to the Scoop. The Beak Ice Cream Scoop\u2019s flat back is great for both round and square ice cream containers. Enjoy our contoured non-slip handle to cushion your hand as you scoop.",
